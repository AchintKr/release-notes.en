### New features and fixes in Adobe Analytics {#aa-features}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |  
| [!DNL AppMeasurement Version 2.14.0] <ul><li>Fixed issues with management of the state of tracker parameters when multiple hits are pending. (AN-176931, AN-176629, DTM-12758)</li><li>Updated AppMeasurement to include Visitor.js 4.3.0 (AN-180049)</li></ul> |
| [!DNL Analysis Workspace]: New _Include Repeat Instances_ Flow visualization setting  | The _Include Repeat Instances_ flow setting gives you the option to include or exclude repeated instances, such as Page Reloads. Additionally, all Flow visualizations are now based on instances only. |  
| [!DNL Ad Hoc Analysis]: Compatibility with Java 11  | Ad Hoc Analysis is now compatible with Java 11. Learn how to run [Ad Hoc Analysis on Java 11](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dsc/adhoc-java.html).|
| **Data Collection:** New s_ecid cookie  | Added a new first-party server cookie, s_ecid, in which data collection stores the visitor's ECID. |

**Analysis Workspace Fixes**

* Fixed an issue affecting **[!UICONTROL Time Spent on Page]**. [!DNL Analysis Workspace] reports will no longer use **[!UICONTROL Page Name]** when calculating **[!UICONTROL Time Spent]** buckets, enabling granular and bucketed hits to be counted. (AN-140479)
* Fixed Line visualization performance issues as part of a larger effort to improve [!DNL Analysis Workspace] performance. (AN-174878)
* Fixed an issue with lack of UTF-8 encoding in downloaded .csv files. (AN-178393)
* Fixed issues with slow [!DNL Analysis Workspace] project performance. (AN-177710)
* Fixed Line visualization display issues with small ranges in the granularity of the y-axis. (AN-176467)

**Other Analytics Fixes**

* [!DNL Audience Analytics]: Fixed an issue that occurred after an audience name was changed in [!DNL Audience Manager (AAM)] â€“ the updated name was not reflected in Audience Analytics. (AN-176237)
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from saving [!DNL Analytics segments in [!DNL Audience Manager]. This was caused by existing AAM folders with mixed uppercase and lowercase names. We now treat all folders as case insensitive so that they will sync. (AN-177934)
* Fixed an issue that occurred when users logged in to [!DNL Analytics] via the [!DNL Experience Cloud] and then the session timed out. When resuming the session, the user was redirected to a faulty URL. (AN-176812)
* Fixed an issue with time zone offsets in [!DNL Data Warehouse] requests. (AN-177585)

### Important notices for Analytics administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
| Upcoming support changes for **[!UICONTROL Date-Enabled]** and **[!UICONTROL Numeric 2 Classifications]** | Updated May 28, 2019 | The ability to import Numeric 2 and Date-Enabled classifications has been removed from the codebase. This change will take effect with the July 2019 Maintenance Release. If you have Numeric or Date-Enabled columns in your import file, those cells will be silently ignored, and any other data within that file will be imported as normal. <br/>Existing classifications can still be exported through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting. |
|Upcoming change to _Report Total_ calculations | Updated May 2, 2019 | On **June 13, 2019**, Adobe Analytics will make _Report Total_ calculations consistent across all dimensions and metrics. This will result in a change to the totals for some reports (typically, Prop or Customer Attributes reports). Prior to this change, some Report Totals inconsistently included or excluded the _Unspecified_ line item in the total, regardless of whether _Unspecified_ appeared in the report. <br/>As of June 13, 2019, _Unspecified_ will always appear in the report total, even if it does not appear as a line item in the report. Additionally, segments using _exists_ or _does not exist_ logic may see different results for some dimensions after this change. This change will affect Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Ad Hoc Analysis, Report Builder, and the Reporting API. |
| Update to CSV downloads from [!DNL Analysis Workspace]| April 10, 2019 | Starting on April 11, 2019, several changes were made to **[!UICONTROL CSV downloads]** (and **[!UICONTORL Copy to Clipboard]**) from [!DNL Analysis Workspace] to remove formatting from exported data.  <ul><li>The thousands separator is no longer included. The decimal separator will continue to be included, and will adhere to the format defined under **[!UICONTROL Components > Report Settings > Thousands Separator]**. Note: Numeric values that use a comma as the decimal separator will continue to be quoted in the exported CSV.</li><li>No currency symbols will be shown.</li><li>No percent symbols will be shown. Percentages will be in decimal form. E.g., 75% will be represented as 0.75.</li><li>Time will be shown in seconds.</li><li>Cohort tables will show raw values only; percentages will be removed.</li><li>If a number is invalid, an empty cell will be displayed.</li></ul>|
| Upcoming change to the [!DNL Analysis Workspace] Debugger command | April 4, 2019 | The Console command to turn on the [!DNL Analysis Workspace] Debugger is changing to adobeTools.debug.includeOberonXml on **June 13, 2019**. adobe.tools.debug.includeOberonXml will cease to function after that date. |
| Mobile browser version numbers | February 7, 2019 | Starting January 8, 2019, we changed the truncation level for mobile browser version numbers from 2 to 1. From that date forward, versions only display the first two levels (e.g. _Firefox 64.0.2_ is now reported as _Firefox 64.0_). |
| End of life for [!DNL Ad Hoc Analysis] | January 29, 2019 | On August 6, 2018, Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life [!DNL Ad Hoc Analysis]. An end-of-life date will be shared once available.<br/>For more information, including which versions of Java will be compatible during this period, visit [Discover Workspace](https://adobe.ly/discoverworkspace). |
| Short Analytics report links | January 14, 2019 | Any short Analytics report links that have not been visited within one year will be cleaned up and deleted starting on Thursday, January 17, 2019, on a rolling schedule. |
| End of Support for TLS 1.0 | Updated January 10, 2019 | As of February 11, 2019 Adobe Analytics reporting no longer supports TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 encryption. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data. If you are unable to connect to Adobe Analytics reporting after February 11, 2019, you should upgrade your browser to the [latest version](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/requirements.html).<br/> As of February 20, 2019 Adobe Analytics data collection no longer supports TLS 1.0. With this change, Adobe no longer collects Analytics data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. We do not expect this to have a significant impact on customer data or reporting. (If your website already does not support TLS 1.0, you will not be affected.) <br/>Beginning April 11, 2019, the Adobe Analytics Reporting API no longer supports TLS 1.0 encryption. Customers who access the API should verify that they will not be impacted. <ul><li>API clients using Java 7 with default settings will need [modifications to support TLS 1.2](https://www.java.com/en/configure_crypto.html). (Refer to _Changing default TLS protocol version for client end points: TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.2_.) </li><li>API clients using Java 8 should not be impacted, because the default setting is TLS 1.2.</li><li> API clients using other frameworks will need to contact their vendors for details on TLS 1.2 support.</li></ul>|
| Data Feed: post_product_list column - size change | January 9, 2019 | On February 7, 2019, Adobe expanded the size of the post_product_list column from 64 KB to 16 MB. This change ensures that merchandising eVar values added to post_product_list during processing do not cause truncation of product and revenue values. If you have processes that ingest post_product_list values, please ensure those processes can handle values up to 16 MB in length, or will truncate the value at 16 KB to avoid data ingestion failures. |
| Management changes affecting inactive [!DNL Analytics Live Stream] endpoints | December 20, 2018 | Starting on February 1, 2019, [!DNL Live Stream] endpoints with no active consumer connections for 90 days may be disabled. You can reach out to Customer Care to inquire about your [!DNL Live Stream] endpoints and, if necessary, have them re-enabled. In addition, please ensure your consumer processes maintain a persistent connection, as intended by the design of the service, and that they are implemented to reconnect when the connection is disconnected or interrupted. |
| Update Adobe [!DNL Report Builder] due to end of support for TLS 1.0 | Sept. 7, 2018 | Due to the end of support for TLS 1.0, we recommended that [!DNL Report Builder] users download version v5.6.21 prior to February 2019. After that date, prior versions of [!DNL Report Builder] will no longer function. |

## Audience Manager {#aam}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |  
| [IP Address Obfuscation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/ip-obfuscation.html)  | Your company may desire to obfuscate IP address in many countries due to global privacy regulations. Audience Manager allows you to obfuscate visitor IP addresses on a global or country-by-country basis. |  
| [Custom Partner Integrations - Oracle Data Cloud](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/custom-partner-integrations.html)  | This page lists custom integrations between Audience Manager and data partners. Audience Manager ingests cookie and mobile ID data from the Oracle Data Cloud for Audience Marketplace via inbound data files. The custom integration specifications described in this page refer only to inbound data files that contain mobile IDs (IDFA and Android Device IDs). |

| --- | --- |
|Single Page App Visual Experience Composer (SPA VEC)|The SPA VEC includes the following enhancements to make your work quicker and more efficient:<ul><li>You can now cancel the loading of a website in the VEC to unblock editing of an activity. This enhancement is useful, for example, if you want to make a small edit to the activity, review its settings, or add custom code and you don't want to wait for the site to load. (TGT-33872)</li><li>You can perform many actions before the page loads in the VEC, or even if the page fails to load altogether (for example, custom code is no longer operational). Actions that cannot be edited before the site loads are disabled in the Target UI. (TGT-33851 & TGT-34149)</li></ul>|
|Automated Personalization (AP) & Auto-Target activities | You can select an experience to be used as control while creating an AP or Auto-Target activity. This feauture lets you route the entire control traffic to a specific experience, based on the traffic allocation percentage configured in the activity. You can then evaluate the performance of the personalized deliveries against the control experience. (TGT-26572)|
|Recommendations | You can use the Recommend Previously Purchased Items toggle while creating Recently Viewed Items logic. (TGT-34030)|

### Enhancement, fixes, and changes

* Toolbar icons display appropriately after you cancel loading of a page within the VEC. If specific actions cannot be performed until after the page is fully loaded, the associated toolbar icons are disabled. (TGT-33811)
