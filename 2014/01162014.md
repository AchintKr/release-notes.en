Fixes for the January 16 2014 release:

* Added friendly names for new iOS devices, such as iPhone 5s, to the device filter list.
* Fixed an issue that caused a blank login page to appear if you logged in with your Adobe ID to marketing.adobe.com or to adobe.com before Adobe mobile services.
* Target campaigns are now created as landing page campaigns instead of A/B campaigns.
* Settings are preserved if you re-add an app after it is deleted. This preserves configuration data if an app is deleted accidentally.
* Fixed an issue that prevented creating a report suite for login companies that did not have ad hoc analytics enabled.
* Fixed an issue that caused a crash when a filter was applied to the `wintitle Overview Report`.
* Removed Chrome browser navigation warnings from pages when data was not at risk of being lost. Chrome browser warnings now appear only when form data has been entered but not saved.
* Fixed an issue that prevented filtering using *city*.
* Graphs now show labels with appropriate granularity instead of always using seconds.
* Fixed an issue that caused activation dates in Target campaigns to sometimes be set with an incorrect time zone.
* Removed unusable options from the entry page on a pathing reports.
* Fixed an issue where autocomplete was populating filter values with friendly names instead of the associated value.
* The `wintitle App Overview Report` in marketing reports &amp; analytics now uses the unique visitors metric instead of the daily engaged users metric.
* Fixed an issue where a graph displayed rounded values while the data table displayed exact values. The graph now displays the value as listed in the data table.
* Fixed an issue that caused a new experience to be inadvertently created when renaming experiences.
* Fixed an issue that caused the key color to not align with the value on some pathing reports.
* Fixed an issue that caused the sidebar to move content to the left even when the sidebar was closed.

>[!NOTE]

>**Important note for all customers using data feeds:** Over the coming months, Adobe is increasing the size of many data feed fields. These changes provide additional functionality in Adobe Analytics, but the larger fields could have an impact on customer ETL (extract, transform, load) processes that ingest data feed data. To prepare for this change, all customers should complete the changes explained in [Data Feed Column Expansion](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/clickstream/?f=datafeeds_whatsnew).

## Marketing Reports & Analytics {#section_9493BB6A60CB4ACDA4FFDA7F005EC31A}

Fixes for the January 2014 release:

* Fixed an issue where the `wintitle Key Metrics Report` displayed incorrect totals for calculated metrics. Calculated metrics now always show "N/A" for the total in this report. This is consistent with all other reports, where calculated metrics are used.
* Fixed an issue where, in Internet Explorer 8 and 9, the dashboard did not display fallout reports.
* Fixed an issue where the correlation between Referrer Type and Referring Domains was not available in the `wintitle Data Extract` wizard.
* Fixed an issue where the breakdown of a classification by a root value worked, but breaking down the root value by a classification did not work. The fix works only for version 15 data.
* Fixed an issue that prevented new BOT rules from being created in Internet Explorer 9 or 10.
* Fixed an issue that caused a database error when a report suite ID started with a number.
* Fixed an issue that caused scheduled reports to fail for trended reports that had no data, and where the delivery format was HTML.
* Fixed an issue where multi-byte characters strings that were sent to the `varname s.pageName` variable were truncated to 100 bytes. This prevented the character from being visible in the `wintitle Pages Report`.
* Fixed an issue that prevented `keyword SearchCenter` reportlets from showing up in dashboards.
* Data sources can now import data for all Marketing Channel types. Previously data sources import was limited to Marketing Channels with a channel type of "offline".
* Web log data sources now properly recognize the URL parts provided in the log files. This resolves issues where URL prefixes were not being recognized correctly.

## Report Builder {#section_DCEDAE09A2DC4FFA8C6EEBA5D6EB58C8}

## Ad Hoc Analysis {#section_642A2BA2BA994BB8B6E0DCD1FE3F66E9}

Fixes for the January 2014 release:

* Non-administrators logging in with the legacy single sign-on (SSO) feature were unable to create a new schedule for reports. After attempting to schedule reports, the standard user would receive an error stating "Ad Hoc Analysis is unable to submit this request at this time. Please try again later." This is now fixed to allow all users the ability to create new report schedules.
* For appropriate fields, an `uicontrol Other` item was added to `wintitle Ad Hoc Analysis` identical to the same fields displayed in `wintitle Marketing Reports and Analytics`.
* The `uicontrol Searches` field will no longer search for "page views" in `wintitle Ad Hoc Analysis`, behaving similar to the `uicontrol Searches` metric in `wintitle Marketing Reports and Analytics`, which does not search for "page views."

## Data Warehouse {#section_23F16B5749A341BE84BD7E23875416D5}

Fixes for the January 2014 release:

* Transactional data sources data (offline data uploaded using a transaction ID) is no longer included in the Visits-All Visitors and Visitors metrics. This was changed to match marketing reports &amp; analytics.
* Case sensitivity for page name-based dimensions (next page, previous page, and so on) now use the same case-sensitivity setting as page name (Page column in reports).
* A change was made to increase performance when reporting multi-valued variables. In reports, each value that is contained in a multiple-valued variable is broken down by every other value, which often results in extremely large data sets and was causing report delivery failure in some circumstances. This change limits the number of breakdowns returned for a list variable to 1000 per hit, instead of limiting the number of multi-valued variables that can be included on a report.
* Added support for adding non-conversion breakdowns (such as props) to a report that includes participation metrics (either event participation or eVar instance participation.) This change matches ad hoc analysis. Previously, the metric reported in this type of report configuration was not a participation metric.
* When applying a segment based on a conversion classification that uses the `term is null` and `term is not null` operators, line items where a key value has been set but no classification value exists were incorrectly filtered. When the `term is not null` filter was applied, these values were excluded. Wen the `term is null` filter was applied, these values were included. These line items are now included and excluded as expected.
* When calculating Time Spent on Page, data warehouse now recognizes when a hit was received with an older timestamp than the previous hit (out-of-order). When this occurs, time spent is now considered to be 0 rather than a negative number.

## Clickstream Data Feeds {#section_B200909431004B2E86A45A829201C23C}

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Important note for all customers using data feeds:** Over the coming months, Adobe is increasing the size of many data feed fields. These changes provide additional functionality in Adobe Analytics, but the larger fields could have an impact on customer ETL (extract, transform, load) processes that ingest data feed data. To prepare for this change, all customers should complete the changes explained in [Data Feed Column Expansion](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/clickstream/?f=datafeeds_whatsnew).

**Fixes**

* Made more than 185 back-end fixes to improve the performance, usability, and reliability of the product.

* Fixed an issue when editing the settings for a Facebook page that caused the `wintitle Owner`, `wintitle Moderation and Insights`, and `wintitle Prediction` settings to not respect their previous settings.
* Fixed an issue that prevented Social campaigns from displaying in the `wintitle Overview Dashboard's``wintitle Campaign` reportlet, even though the campaigns displayed correctly in the `wintitle Social Campaigns` report.
* Fixed an issue with the `wintitle Overview Dashboard` that caused data to be missing from its `wintitle Social Buzz` reportlet, even though data displayed correctly in the `wintitle Social Buzz` report.
* Fixed an issue that caused the `wintitle Overview Dashboard` and `wintitle Social Buzz` report to contain no data when customers with a large number of listening rules had some empty `wintitle Display Name` classifications.
* Fixed an issue on the `wintitle Overview Dashboard's``wintitle Social Buzz` reportlet that sometimes caused "unspecified" to display as a listening rule.
* Fixed an issue that caused the `wintitle Overview Dashboard`'s `wintitle Campaigns` reportlet to be blank when `wintitle Instances` was the selected metric.
* Made changes to the `wintitle Social Buzz` report so that if an incompatible classification and display name are used as filters, the report is blank (no metric data displays). This change ensures that the expected results display.
* Fixed a display issue where the `wintitle Real-Time` selector was misaligned in a minimized `wintitle Social Buzz` report window.
* Made changes to the metric selector in the `wintitle Social Buzz` report so that it contains all active listening rules, even if rules have no mentions.

* Fixed an issue that prevented all post types from displaying in the `wintitle Campaign Timeline` reportlet in the `wintitle Campaign Details` report.

* Fixed an issue that caused inconsistent numbers reported for ctx.ly links in the `wintitle Post Analytics` report.

* Fixed an issue that caused broken links after customers copied shortened URLs from the `wintitle Publisher` and pasted them elsewhere (in a reply, for example).
* Fixed an issue with the Facebook API that was causing posts to fail.
* Fixed an issue that caused links displayed in the `wintitle Publisher` preview and in the `wintitle Content Calendar` to be different than the links in the posts after being published to Facebook.
* Fixed an issue that prevented changes made by the auto-correction feature in the `wintitle Content Calendar` from persisting in the published post.
* Fixed an issue that caused images to be rotated after being published.
* Fixed an issue that caused unreliable video posting to Facebook.
* Fixed a display issue that some customers experienced when creating posts in the `wintitle Content Calendar`. In some situations, this issue caused edited posts to contain the original text after being published.
* Fixed an issue with the `wintitle Predictive Publisher` feature that sometimes caused it to recommend odd times (during the night, for example) or times in the past.
* Fixed an issue that caused discrepancies in the number of engagements displayed on an application's tile on the `wintitle Apps Overview` page and the number reported after exporting the application's results by clicking the wrench icon.

* Changed the behavior when users log in to Social from one computer or browser and then subsequently log in to the same account using a different computer or browser. The previously selected report suite automatically loads regardless of the computer or browser used.
* Fixed an issue that caused Social to load exceptionally slow for certain customers, which made it appear that the product wasn't functioning correctly.
