As of January 30, 2015, only the current version of Adobe Analytics Report Builder (5.0.50), the Adobe Analytics add-in for Excel, will be able to connect to Adobe Analytics; previous versions will cease to connect. This change is the result of a number of security enhancements being made on that date. All users must update to version 5.0.50 or higher (released October 21, 2014) before January 30, 2015. If you choose not to upgrade, you will be unable to log in to Report Builder or retrieve data through Report Builder after January 30, 2015 until you install the latest version. See [ Upgrading Report Builder ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/arb/?f=upgrade_arb) to find out how to check the version that you are currently using, as well as how to upgrade to the latest version.

## New Features in Analytics {#features_analytics}


|  Component/Feature  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Data warehouse  | Added support for summary data sources in data warehouse reports. This lets you report on metrics such as search engine (pre-click) data from Adobe Media Optimizer.  |


## Marketing Reports &amp; Analytics {#fixes_reports_analytics}

**Fixes** 

* Refined the way that visit and visitor metrics are calculated when only part of a visit is included in the selected reporting period, breakdown, or segment. After this change, if no measurable data for a metric is collected for the part of the visit that is included in the report, then a visit is not counted. **This change will result in a small decrease in several metrics including entries, exits, visits, visitors, single access, bounces, and visitor home page**. For example, if a visit starts with a page view at 11:58pm on January 1, then ends with an exit link at 12:01am on January 2nd, a visit is not counted when reporting for the day of January 2nd only because a page view did not occur on that date. **This change will also result in a small increase in Time Spent Per Visit and Time Spent Per Visitor**, since a visit is no longer counted if there is not a value for time spent included in the calculation (since the last hit of a visit does not record time spent, if the report contains only the last hit due to filtering, a visit is no longer counted).

## Ad Hoc Analysis {#fixes_ad_hoc}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue where a segment that uses the *` Then`* operator showed compatibility with Ad Hoc Analysis in the Reports &amp; Analytics Segment Builder. However, when running a report with the segment in Ad Hoc Analysis, it showed an error. The segment showed another error when attempting to save it in the Ad Hoc Analysis Segment Builder.

## Data Workbench {#fixes_data_workbench}

## Search&amp;Promote {#section_D28F5C0158D64702896CF29E3887E42A}

**New feature** 


* 

  When you want to apply trigger conditions to a Business Rule, in the Advanced Rule Builder, following **[!UICONTROL  If any/all of the following conditions are met]**, in the first drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL  keyword]**, and then select the new operator **[!UICONTROL  equal exact]** in the second drop-down list. 



**Fixed and enhancements** 


* 

* 

* Editing an existing Business Rule that has a status of "approved" now revokes the "approved" status. You must use [!UICONTROL  Advanced Rule Builder] to recheck the option **[!UICONTROL  Approved]**, and then save the rule as usual. If you do not reapprove an edited rule, the rule's status is automatically set to WIP (Work In Progress) on the [!UICONTROL  Business Rules] page. 

* A new **[!UICONTROL  Advanced Search]** option is now available on the [!UICONTROL  Business Rules] page for improved filtering of rules. 

* Added **[!UICONTROL  contains word]** condition to rule triggers in Query Cleaning, Pre-Search Rules, Post Search Rules, and Business Rules, to let you easily specify word breaks. 

* Improvements made to Business Rule notes. For example, you view a rule, you can now retrieve the notes history for that rule. Also, notes are now logged in **[!UICONTROL  Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL  Change Log]**. 

* Queries with non-zero ` sp_i` values are no longer run through the [!DNL  SiteCatalyst] redirector.
