## Marketing Cloud 15.9 {#marketing_cloud_interface}

New features and fixes in the [!DNL  Adobe Marketing Cloud] interface. 

Release date: **September 10, 2015**

**Documentation Updates** 

Solution administrators, see [Users and Groups](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/?f=user_mgmt_admin) for important information about mapping solution groups to broader Adobe groups, and bulk-add users in the [Enterprise Dashboard](http://aedash.adobe.com/). 

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an Audience Manager API performance issue causing intermittent timeouts when uploading customer attributes data. (MAC-26305)
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from adding up to 200 customer attributes to a subscription. (MAC-26188)
* Fixed a previous known issue on the Customer attributes - Edit Schema page that was causing a Content Aware error to be issued when changing a display name. (MAC-25589, AN-103834)
**Known Issue** 

An Audience Library known issue exists that might prevent audience sharing from Analytics segmentation, causing the audience size to perpetually remain at 0 (zero). This issue can occur if the number of audience members exceeds 50,000. As a workaround, Adobe recommends reducing the segment size to under 50,000 audience members. (MAC-25788) 

See [Marketing Cloud Product Documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/) for product help.

## Dynamic Tag Management {#dtm}

**Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service Tool Update: **On September 22, DTM will release an update to the Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service tool. The newest library version (1.6.1) will enable improved customer ID support, added support for authenticated state and improved multi-solution integration. 

The newest version is completely compatible with current deployments of the Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service via DTM. To help all users benefit from this update we will automatically migrate your account to the new Marketing Cloud ID Service library. 

As a result of this migration you will see added functionality to your Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service tool in DTM. We suggest that you test this update in your staging environment before publishing. 

The DTM team strives to add value for our customers, and we are confident that you will see this realized in the update to the Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service tool. 

**Amazon S3 Deprecation: **Adobe has deprecated the use of Amazon S3 as a DTM library hosting option. 

Adobe will no longer support Amazon S3. Your dynamic tag management libraries on Amazon S3 will continue to be served until December 31, 2015, but in a read-only state. Any changes made in dynamic tag management will no longer be reflected in these files. 

To deploy additional changes to your site after July 31, 2015, you must select one of our other hosting options. Self-hosting (FTP Delivery or Library Download) is always the suggested best practice, but our 3rd-party Akamai hosting is a world-class option as well. 

The September 3, 2015 dynamic tag management release includes the following changes:

  </tr>

**Fixes and Enhancements: ** 


* Improved the deployment of the satellite library (2-5 times speed increase). Customers with many rules or who are deploying many third-party tags will greatly benefit from these changes.
* Improved the upload speed to Akamai (up to 5 times faster).
* Improved the load speed (2 times faster) for all rule listing pages.
* Fixed an issue that prevented some pages from loading in Internet Explorer (users received a pop-up error message).

**Documentation Updates** 

Analytics Administrators: If you are an administrator in the Marketing Cloud, see [Users and Groups](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/?f=user_mgmt_admin) for updated information about mapping Analytics groups to broader Adobe groups, and bulk-add users in the [Enterprise Dashboard](http://aedash.adobe.com/). 

## Reports &amp; Analytics Fixes {#fixes_reports_analytics}


* Fixed an issue that prevented the provisioning of 100 eVars and 1,000 events. (AN-107899)
* Fixed an issue that prevented two advanced functions from appearing in the Calculated Metric Builder: Cumulative and Cumulative Average. (AN-108072)
* Fixed an issue that prevented Custom eVars from being shown in the [!UICONTROL  Reports] menu. (AN-107387)
* Fixed an issue where a graph in a PDF-downloaded [!UICONTROL  Targets] report did not match the graph in the web interface. (AN-107389)
* Fixed an issue that prevented some publishing widgets from being displayed. (AN-101551)
* Fixed an issue that caused the numbers on the time axis in normalized trended reports to not line up with the dotted lines. (AN-99445)
* Fixed an issue that occurred after creating a user group in Reports & Analytics and selecting it as the default user group. The attempt to change the default group back to *` None`* failed with an error message. (AN-108270)
* Fixed an issue that prevented Visitor Profile &amp;gt; Customer Attributes reports from showing up in the menu. (AN-106265)
* Fixed an issue that caused users’ screens to be greyed out after logging in to [!DNL  Analytics], when there was no graph present on the landing page. (AN-105470)
* Fixed an issue with Adobe Media Optimizer data feeds. (AN-106116)
* Updated our search engine detection logic to count encrypted traffic from Bing as “keyword unavailable”. (AN-106209)
* Fixed a segmentation issue that occurred when nesting containers within containers, causing data to be included when it should be excluded. For example, the issue occurred when there were two containers nested (using visitors/visits/hits), and you wanted to exclude visits where the visit number (hit depth) is greater than one. If the outer container had one container within the date range and one outside of the date range, visitors would be counted if they qualified in either container. (AN-107936)
