**Fixes** 

* Minor bug fixes and performance enhancements
See [Adobe Mobile Services](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/) for product documentation. To see the release notes for previous releases, expand *Previous Release Notes* in the left pane. 

**Update August 23, 2017** 

As of August 22, Adobe Analytics will begin determining geo_zip on all hits received during data collection. This update increases data accuracy, particularly for mobile devices. Previously, the geo_zip was set once per visit. Now, geo_zip can correctly change during the course of a visitor's visit. The geo_zip field is not used in reporting, but surfaces in Data Feeds. 

**Update August 21, 2017** 

On August 22, Adobe Analytics will enable [Geo Segementation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/reports_geosegmentation.html) reports for all customers. This change is in anticipation of the upcoming removal of the geo segmentation settings in the Admin Console. 

Release date: **August 17, 2017**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>As of the September 2017 release, Ad Hoc Analysis is terminating support for Java versions less than 1.7.0_76. Our .jar files are signed with a secure 256-bit encryption that is not supported by Java versions less than 1.7.0_76. This 256-bit certificate allows us to serve you with enhanced security. The August 2017 release will continue to support previous versions.Additionally, beginning in September 2017, the Ad Hoc Analysis launch page will temporarily include a link to an unsupported version of the product for use with Java versions older than 1.7.0_76. If you are using Java 1.7.0_76 or older, please begin working with your IT team to secure an upgrade to a more recent version of Java as soon as possible.

## Audience Manager

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* Fixed a visual bug in the destination view where an extra tooltip icon would appear every time a user would select another value in the Devices reachable drop-down window. (AAM-28010) 
* Users linked with [Organization IDs](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/ids-in-aam.html) can now log into the Audience Manager UI with their Adobe ID instead of username and password. (AAM-28161) 
* The Search screen in Audience Marketplace now includes a link to [Audience Finder](https://www.adobe-audience-finder.com/). Use Audience Finder to discover partners who can provide the right type of data feed for your campaign. (AAM-30241) 
* Fixed an issue where users were able to delete test segment mappings in Audience Lab, even through they were used in a destination. (AAM-29964) 
* Users with administrator permissions receive an automated mail message when access to a shared data feed is revoked. Mail messages now include a link in the mail to the product documentation site, explaining why the access was revoked. (AAM-30625) 
* Fixed a bug where the destinations modal window would extend past the browser's window size. (AAM-30893)
* Folder traits are excluded from the list of influential traits in algorithmic modeling. (AAM-30960) 
* Fixed a bug where deleting a destination mapping would take a long time. (AAM-31338) 
* Fixed a UI error where Addressable Audience related metrics would show zero instead of N/A for non-applicable metrics. (AAM-31712) 
* Fixed an issue where the UI was slow to respond on multiple pages for customers who have hundreds of data sources set up. (AAM-31788) 

**DIL Bug Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecated Code** 

[DIL](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/dil-overview.html) is the API data collection code for Audience Manager. The August release increments DIL to version 6.11. 


* Added a new configuration ` isCoopSafe`. This is an optional, Boolean configuration that determines if DIL sends data to the [!DNL  Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op]. See [isCoopSafe](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/?f=dil-coopsafe.html). (CORE-4334)

**Important Documentation Updates** 

We've rewritten the documentation on how to work with our Data Collection Server (DCS) APIs. Start with the [DCS Server API Methods and Code](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/dcs-intro.html) and work your way up to more intricate operations with our DCS APIs.
