## Marketing Cloud ID Service {#mcvid}


<!-- <p>https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/MCID/Visitor+API+Release+Log </p> -->

This release increments the [!DNL  Marketing Cloud] ID service code (` VisitorAPI.js`) to version 2.0. It includes the following features, fixes, and other changes. 


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The ID service code v2.0 automatically synchronizes IDs with [!DNL  Adobe Media Optimizer] by default. See also, [Understanding ID Synchronization and Match Rates](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-match-rates.html). 



Fixes: 

* Fixed a bug that prevented AppMeasurement from making tracking calls to Analytics. (MCID-254, MCID-256, MCID-286)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the ID service from failing right away if a visitor had enabled an ad blocker and that blocker was configured to exclude the [!DNL  demdex.net] domain. This is a rare and unusual bug because most ad blocking tools do not block the [!DNL  demdex.net] domain. (MCID-233)
* Fixed a bug caused by interactions between ID service code and a custom script on a customer's website. This issue prevented Internet Explorer 9 from loading Web pages. (MCID-206)

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

Fixes: 


* Fixed a SQL bug that returned a system error message instead of a user-friendly message when creating a server-to-server destination. (AAM-21187)
* Fixed a bug with the [!UICONTROL  Traits] landing page select all check box that prevented you from selecting all the traits in the list. (AAM-26031)
* Fixed a bug in the [!UICONTROL  Visitor Profile Viewer] that displayed dates in the local time rather than in the UTC time zone. (AAM-26061)
* Fixed a bug that let users with Admin permissions create a folder with ID 0 that could not be deleted. (AAM-26558)
* Fixed a bug that prevented some customers that have assigned Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) to user groups from working with segments. (AAM-26632)
* Fixed a bug that returned data from a deleted data source. (AAM-26716)
* Fixed a bug that prevented [!UICONTROL  Profile Merge Rules] from loading in Internet Explorer. (AAM-27557)
* Fixed a bug in [!UICONTROL  Audience Marketplace] that sent empty .csv files to data buyers when data providers revoked access to a data feed. (AAM-27671)


Enhancements include: 


* Design changes to the [!UICONTROL  Destinations] and [!UICONTROL  Segments] details pages that are designed to help improve usability. (AAM-25723)
* New 14-day, 90-day, and lifetime date ranges for segment populations. (AAM-27712)


**DIL Bug Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecated Code** 

[!UICONTROL  DIL] is the API data collection code for [!DNL  Audience Manager]. The January release increments [!UICONTROL  DIL] to version 6.8. 

This release changes the way the ` DIL.create` function responds when it encounters an error. With v6.8, [!UICONTROL  DIL] throws a descriptive error that stops code execution and indicates the nature of the error. 

**New and Revised Documentation** 

New: 

[CSV Files for Overlap Reports](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/overlap-csv-files.html). You can request a .csv file for an [!UICONTROL  Overlap Report] when that report reaches its 1-million record limit. 

Revised: 

* [Product Features and Functions FAQ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/faq_features_functions.html) includes a new entry about how to find your [!UICONTROL  Organization ID].
* [Data Collection and Product Integration FAQ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/faq_data_collection_integration.html) includes a new entry about white-listing [!DNL  Audience Manager] IP and FTP addresses.
* [Privacy and Data Retention FAQ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/faq_privacy.html) includes revised privacy content.
* [Traffic DIL in Google Tag Manager (GTM)](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/t_dil_google_tagmanager.html) describes how you can load DIL code in the custom HTML section of a tag.
* [TraitWeight](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_algo_how_works.html) includes new information about an extra step in the algorithmic discovery process.
* [Data Sampling Error Rates in Selected Audience Manager Reports](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/report-sampling.html) includes new information about how data sampling works.
* [Amazon S3 Name and File Size Requirements for Inbound Data Files](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/inbound-s3-filenames.html) includes new information about how the validation process reacts to empty data files.
