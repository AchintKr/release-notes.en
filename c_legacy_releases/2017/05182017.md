## Experience Cloud and Core Services

Release notes for the core services interface, including Assets, Feed, Profiles &amp; Audiences, Mobile Services, and Dynamic Tag Management. Also includes release information for Marketing Cloud Identity Service (Visitor API). 

### Marketing Cloud ID Service {#mcvid}


<!-- After another meeting, the consensus is that the team cannot determine if some projects being worked on now will release at all this month. If they do, the ID service version will increment to v2.2 and will have a new feature for iFrame/parent page communication. However, unable to determine this by the time the early release notes are due, May 10. So for now, all the ID service has is this blurb below about a revised doc. MCID-394 -->

**Revised Documentation** 

[Understanding ID Synchronization and Match Rates](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-match-rates.html) includes new information about the ` cm.eversttech.net` call the ID service makes to [!DNL  Adobe Media Optimizer]. 

See [Marketing Cloud ID Services](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/) product documentation.
