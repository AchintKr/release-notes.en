**Bug Fixes and Other Changes** 


* Fixed a Chrome-related bug that caused the ID service to throw an error when clicking the back button in that browser. (CORE-5135)
* The ID service now re-fires ID syncs when the region ID in the event call response changes. (CORE-4342)
* Added new documentation, [Content Security Policies and the Marketing Cloud ID Service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/?f=mcvid-csp.html) that explains how to whitelist calls to Adobe domains used by the ID service.


See [Marketing Cloud ID Services](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/) product documentation. 

## Mobile Services {#mobile}

Minor bug fixes. 

See [Adobe Mobile Services](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/) for product documentation. To see the release notes for previous releases, expand *Previous Release Notes* in the left pane. 

## Data Connectors {#section_190F5136147643AFB77E9CF1A067C438}

**ExactTarget Data Connector Integration with Adobe Analytics** 

Salesforce recently discontinued the ExactTarget Data Connector integration. Because of this decision, the ExactTarget wizard is no longer accessible in the Data Connectors interface for new implementations. 

The ExactTarget integration will continue to be visible for customers that have previously configured the integration. Existing implementations will continue to function for an unspecified length of time (to be determined by Salesforce). If your customers have questions, advise them to contact their Salesforce/ExactTarget representative. 

**Going forward** 

Analytics customers can implement custom integrations for ExactTarget using standard Analytics features and APIs, including Classifications, Data Sources, Processing Rules, and Data Warehouse exports. Engagements with the Adobe consulting team can be considered as needed.
