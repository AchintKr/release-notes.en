Last Update - August 25, 2016 

## Experience Cloud

### Marketing Cloud ID Service {#mcvid}

This release increments the ID service code to version 1.7.0. It includes the following features, bug fixes, and other changes. 

**Fixes and Improvements** 

* Added ` idSyncAttachIframeOnWindowLoad` as an optional Boolean flag you can set in the ` Visitor.getInstance` function. When ` idSyncAttachIframeOnWindowLoad= true`, the ID service loads the ID synchronization iFrame on window load. By default, the ID service loads the iFrame as fast as possible. This flag *replaces* ` idSyncAttachIframeASAP`, which is deprecated. See [Variables Used by the ID Service getInstance Function](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/?f=mcvid-variables.html). (MCID-122)
* Added functionality to support tracking [!DNL  Marketing Cloud] IDs across domains, native apps and hybrid apps to web transitions. See [Append Visitor ID Helper Function](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-appendvisitorid.html). (MCID-42)
* Added functions to visitorAPI.js code that determine if the ID service has generated the visitor [!DNL  Marketing Cloud] ID client-side or server-side or if ID calls timed out. See [Timeout Tracking Functions](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/?f=mcvid-timeout-functions.html) and [Tracking Client-side Visitor ID Generation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/?f=mcvid-client-side-id.html). (MCID-116)

**Known Issues** 

Customers using [!DNL  Audience Manager] DIL code and visitorAPI.js code on the same page should set the DIL variable ` secureDataCollection= false`. See [secureDataCollection](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/?f=dil-secure-data-collection.html). 

** Maintenance Release: August 18, 2016**

   <td colname="col2"> <p>Sometime between the February and March Maintenance Releases, the following Analytics data processing change was implemented: </p> <p>Previously, when using the Product variable without having an event set, the event would default to "ProdView", set early in processing (before processing rules take effect). The event is now set after the processing rules to avoid conflicts with how mobile data processing works. This change has the following downstream effects: </p> 
    <ul id="ul_E85DDAAFE9654D8A9B635FDCE8E4FA7E"> 
     <li id="li_A18A2DAE2A97440D977A745E7C99404E">ProdViews are no longer inflated because of hits where context data is generating events (especially in Mobile). Going forward, an event will be set at the time in data processing when the ProdView would have been set (without a set event.) </li> 
     <li id="li_75F4B73AE98241E3A900A526460CD70D">Any VISTA rule that has logic depending on a ProdView event being set on a hit might need to be reviewed to see if changes to the VISTA rule are needed. This is because ProdView events might be set on fewer hits than they previously were, because ProdView is set earlier in the processing pipeline. This change may or may not impact what is desired from the VISTA rule. </li>

Test segments can be used to evaluate different variables (e.g., targeting platforms or targeting criteria) while controlling for an audience variable.

**Fixes and Enhancements** 

* Added new reporting features to [!UICONTROL  Addressable Audiences]. (AAM-24411)
* Fixed a Segment Builder bug that prevented you from adding traits to new segments when using Chrome. (AAM-24994)
* Fixed a bug that prevented administrators from assigning permissions to groups with a large number of data sources. (AAM-24870)
* Fixed a bug that prevented segment folders from expanding and showing sub-folders or segments. (AAM-25054)
* Fixed a bug in the [!UICONTROL  Onboarding Status Report] that shifted the date range 1-day earlier than the selected date. (AAM-25484)
* Fixed a broken link to help documentation in [!UICONTROL  Data Source Settings]. (AAM-25447)

**DIL Bug Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecated Code** 

DIL is the API data collection code for [!DNL  Audience Manager]. The July release increments DIL to version 6.5. Upgrade to the latest version to take advantage of these features and fixes. 

* Fixed a bug that prevented DIL code from being deployed in Firefox. (AAM-24708)
* Added a title attribute to the DIL iFrame. An iFrame title helps screen readers provide page information to users who require assistance when interacting with online content. (AAM-25317)
* Added DIL support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). See [useCorsOnly](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/?f=dil-use-cors-only.html). (AAM-25319, AAM-20139).
* The DIL iFrame supports the ` iframe.sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin';` attributes. Allowing only these 2 tokens helps improve security. For more information, see the Attributes section in this [iFrame documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). (AAM-23335)
* DIL now makes secure, HTTPS calls by default. Customers using [!DNL  Audience Manager] DIL code and visitorAPI.js code on the same page should set the DIL variable ` secureDataCollection= false`. See [secureDataCollection](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/?f=dil-secure-data-collection.html).


**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* Increased frequency and lifetime of Facebook metrics data collection. New data collection time frame is as follows: 

    * All Facebook metrics are collected every hour for the first 72 hours after a post is posted.
    * Continue data collection every 8 hours for the next 72 hours.
    * Continue data collection daily thereafter for the next 60 days.

* Added a Geotarget column for Twitter in the Post Analytics report export.
* Five new Facebook reaction metrics are now available in both Post Analytics and Property Analytics reports. They include: Love, Wow, Sad, Haha, and Angry. In an upcoming release, Facebook reactions metrics will also be available in Adobe Analytics reports.
* Fixed an issue where clicking the magnifying glass on a private Twitter post within [!DNL  Social Buzz] looped you back to the same page instead of opening the original post in Twitter.
* Fixed an issue where some escalated tweets were unable to be claimed.
* Fixed an issue where Social Buzz reports generated on different days were dropping certain posts.
* Fixed an issue where changing feed settings within Unified Moderation did not save after logging out and back in.
* Fixed an issue where URLs in quoted tweets were taking up more than the expected 24 characters.
