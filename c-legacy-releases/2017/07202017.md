   <td colname="col2"> <p>(Portfolios with the setting to "Model and optimize search on an intraday basis") Media Optimizer now takes revenue data into account when changing bids and campaign budgets to meet intraday trends. Previously, only click data was considered. </p> <p>Now, bids are increased during the higher-performing parts of the day. </p> </td>

Existing standard text ads will continue to run after 31 July and will be read-only. </p> <p>In Bing Ads inventory feed templates for text ads, the ability to add new standard text ads is already removed. Existing templates that already include standard text ad variations will continue to be processed and run until sometime before July 31 (date to be determined). If your text ad templates include standard text ad variations, convert them to expanded text ad variations by creating new expanded text ad variations, copying the values from the standard text ad variations to them, and then removing the standard text ad variations. </p> <p>You can continue to use bulksheets and the Ads tab to create and edit standard text ads though 31 July. </p> </td>

When all the campaigns have the same priority, the campaign with the highest bid is eligible. </p> </td>

      <li id="li_2DB3D78048FB40768D293BD52D2D74AB">(Some advertisers) You can manually request synchronization of your campaigns. This gathers entities on the search network that are new or changed. For campaigns with the option to "Auto-Upload during Sync," the sync operation also generates and posts tracking codes that are missing or need to be changed in the destination URLs or tracking templates. The sync operation doesn't create a bulksheet like it does in the legacy Campaigns UI. </li>
