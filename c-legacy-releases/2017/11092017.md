### Adobe Launch {#section_216AA62C26D24484A999008CB1E4C095}

This is the first release of Launch. 

Release date: **November 8, 2017**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Launch is being rolled out incrementally to Adobe Experience Cloud customers. If you have would like a chance to get early access, please put let us know by entering the required information in the[Launch Release Form](https://adobe.allegiancetech.com/cgi-bin/qwebcorporate.dll?WVFJ3K). 

Launch is the next-generation of tag management capabilities from Adobe. Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences. 

Launch empowers anyone to build and maintain their own integrations with Launch, called Extensions. These extensions are available to Launch customers in an app-store experience so they can quickly install, configure, and deploy their tags. 

Launch is offered to Adobe Experience Cloud customers as an included, value-add feature. Launch is an entirely new product with a new code base, designed to replace the previous Dynamic Tag Management (DTM) service. However, DTM will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future. Adobe will continue to fix any significant bugs and ensure consistent performance. At this time, no major feature enhancements are planned for legacy DTM. 

**Key Benefits** 

* Faster time to value
* Trustworthy data through centralized collection, organization, and delivery using data elements
* Compelling experiences through the integration of data and marketing technology using rule builder

**Other Highlights** 

Launch provides several improvements over similar systems, including: 

* No use of ` document.write ()` where Chrome doesn't allow it ​
* The Page Top and Page Bottom rules are bundled into the main library to minimize unnecessary HTTP calls ​ ​
* Custom action scripts within a rule can be loaded in parallel, but are executed sequentially ​
* If you avoid Page Top and Page Bottom rules, the code is mostly asynchronous, with a path to getting fully async ​

### Mobile Services {#mobile}

New features, updates, and fixes to Mobile Services. 

Release date: **November 9, 2017**
