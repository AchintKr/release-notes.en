**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* Fixed a bug in Algorithmic Modeling where, for multiple customers, algorithmic traits created or modified after August 23rd weren't qualifying the expected number of profiles for the trait. (AAM-32586) 
* Fixed a performance issue where parts of the UI were slow to respond for companies with a large number of data sources. (AAM-32747) 
* Fixed a bug where a 3rd party traits folder was not being automatically created for a company if the corresponding data source was created before the company was marked as Data Provider. (AAM-32176) 
* Fixed a bug that appeared when creating or editing a cookie destination. In the "Configuration" panel, the "Publish data to" field allows you to type in a domain name and add it to a list of domains when either "Only the selected domains" or "All of our domains except the selected domains" is selected. The "Add" button next to this text field did not actually add the typed-in domain to the list. (AAM-32679) 

**New Documentation**
