   <td colname="col2"> <p><b>Background</b> </p> <p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies as from May 25, 2018, provides that Adobe, in its role as your data processor, must take appropriate measures to assist its customers in fulfilling access, deletion, and other requests from individuals. Applying appropriate, secure, and timely deletion policies is an important part of complying with this obligation. As a result, Adobe would like to work with you to implement a data retention policy before GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018. </p> <p><b>What to expect</b> </p> <p>Unless you already have an Adobe Analytics data retention policy in place, Adobe will begin applying data retention as currently specified in customer contracts for Adobe Analytics, unless other arrangements are made. </p> <p>Most Adobe Analytics contracts state that Adobe may delete data after 25 months. Once a data retention policy is in place for your organization, it is enforced on a rolling monthly basis. Data retention for longer periods than 25 months is available for an additional fee. Data retention periods for shorter periods can also be configured by contacting Customer Care. </p> <p> You will soon receive an email with additional details for your organization. </p> <p>Data retention impacts all methods for accessing historical Adobe Analytics data, including but not limited to Reports &amp; Analytics, Analysis Workspace, Report Builder, the Web Services Reporting APIs, data warehouse, and data feeds. </p> <p><b>Next steps</b> </p> <p>Identify stakeholders within your organization responsible for making decisions about data retention.

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations**

* This release includes an API optimization. Customers were experiencing latency with the get_children method in the Folders API. (AAM-37237) 
* We fixed a bug in Segment Builder where the information modal would return an incorrect status for expression validity. For example, for incorrect expressions, the modal would show "Success" and for correct expressions, the modal would read "Error". (AAM-36980)
