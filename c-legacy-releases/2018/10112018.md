   <td colname="col2"> <p><b>Background</b> </p> <p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies as from May 25, 2018, provides that Adobe, in its role as your data processor, must take appropriate measures to assist its customers in fulfilling access, deletion, and other requests from individuals. Applying appropriate, secure, and timely deletion policies is an important part of complying with this obligation. As a result, Adobe would like to work with you to implement a data retention policy before GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018. </p> <p><b>What to expect</b> </p> <p>Unless you already have an Adobe Analytics data retention policy in place, Adobe will begin applying data retention as currently specified in customer contracts for Adobe Analytics, unless other arrangements are made. </p> <p>Most Adobe Analytics contracts state that Adobe may delete data after 25 months. Once a data retention policy is in place for your organization, it is enforced on a rolling monthly basis. Data retention for longer periods than 25 months is available for an additional fee. Data retention periods for shorter periods can also be configured by contacting Customer Care. </p> <p> You will soon receive an email with additional details for your organization. </p> <p>Data retention impacts all methods for accessing historical Adobe Analytics data, including but not limited to Reports &amp; Analytics, Analysis Workspace, Report Builder, the Web Services Reporting APIs, data warehouse, and data feeds. </p> <p><b>Next steps</b> </p> <p>Identify stakeholders within your organization responsible for making decisions about data retention. Your organization is best placed to know the appropriate period for which Adobe Analytics data should be retained. </p> <p>Contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager if you have questions regarding data retention for Adobe Analytics. </p> </td>

* **Cloud Manager 2018.7.0** 

  This Cloud Manager release provides key improvements around autoscaling, code quality analysis, detailed view of your environments and performance testing. [Release Notes](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/cloud-manager/using/release-notes-2018-7-0.html). 

* **SPA Editor** 

  As Single-Page Application (SPA) makes the overall visitor experience more interactive, they are gaining popularity, even for content-centric experiences. So far, it was tedious-when possible at all-for Web Experience Management Systems to edit in-context the content and layout of SPAs. The disruptive architecture only consumes JSON data from the server and delegates all other responsibilities, such as rendering, to the client. As a result, marketers are forced to use headless-only CMS and initiate a development cycle for any layout change. Control is lost over any form of layout, impacting the velocity of changes. 

  The SPA Editor, however, brings the easy-to-use capabilities of the AEM Page Editor back to SPA built with JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. It allows front-end developers to create such SPA like they are used to, all while having non-technical authors to edit the content in-place. 

  This release is version one of the SPA Editor. The editor, provides support for the React and Angular JS frameworks. 

  See the following documentation: [https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/spa-overview.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/spa-overview.html) 

* **Adobe Stock integration with AEM** 

  Integration with Adobe Stock gives AEM users the ability to do the following: 

    * Extend search results to Adobe Stock directly in the AEM user interface. 
    * Preview Adobe Stock assets. 
    * Save and license Adobe Stock assets into AEM without leaving the familiar AEM user interface. 

  Licensed and saved assets become available as regular assets that are managed in AEM.
