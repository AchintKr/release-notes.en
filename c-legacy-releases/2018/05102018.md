As a result, Adobe would like to work with you to implement a data retention policy before GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018. </p> <p><b>What to expect</b> </p> <p>Unless you already have an Adobe Analytics data retention policy in place, Adobe will begin applying data retention as currently specified in customer contracts for Adobe Analytics, unless other arrangements are made. </p> <p>Most Adobe Analytics contracts state that Adobe may delete data after 25 months. Once a data retention policy is in place for your organization, it is enforced on a rolling monthly basis. Data retention for longer periods than 25 months is available for an additional fee. Data retention periods for shorter periods can also be configured by contacting Customer Care. </p> <p> You will soon receive an email with additional details for your organization. </p> <p>Data retention impacts all methods for accessing historical Adobe Analytics data, including but not limited to  <span class="uicontrol"> Reports & Analytics </span>, <span class="uicontrol"> Analysis Workspace</span>, <span class="uicontrol"> Report Builder</span>, the Web Services Reporting APIs, data warehouse, and data feeds. </p> <p><b>Next steps</b> </p> <p>Identify stakeholders within your organization responsible for making decisions about data retention. Your organization is best placed to know the appropriate period for which Adobe Analytics data should be retained. </p> <p>Contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager if you have questions regarding data retention for Adobe Analytics. </p> </td>
