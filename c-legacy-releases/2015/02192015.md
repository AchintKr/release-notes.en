### Adobe Mobile Services {#mobile}

**Fixes** 

* Restored the [!UICONTROL  In-App Messaging Names] report (which was removed in January) to the main menu.
* The Acquisition > Overview main chart title is now *` Top Campaigns`* rather than *` Key Performance Indicators`*. This change better describes the type of information being displayed.
* Updated the [!UICONTROL  Retention Report] to support the modified Gregorian calendar so that correct weekly values are returned.

* Added a deprecation warning message for all company administrators using Amazon hosting for their JavaScript library.
* Improved the error handling for instances where [!DNL  document.write] is not available.
* Addressed various localization issues to increase the user experience for supported languages.
* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL  Channel] field was not included in rules specifying a ` s.tl()` call in [!DNL  Adobe Analytics].
* Fixed an issue where copied rules were not automatically added to the staging library until a change was made to the rules.
* Fixed an issue where Regex was firing for rules using the “parameters” condition option, even if the parameter wasn’t present.

### Marketing Reports &amp; Analytics {#fixes_reports_analytics}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue that caused Current Data to show new values only when the reporting period is *` current day`* and not *` current week`* or *` current month`* even though the current day should be included.


### Unified Segmentation {#section_403971F2BCD442CF9D0D6489EB69C697}

These changes apply to all unified segmentation features in Adobe [!DNL Analytics], including the Reports & Analytics and Ad Hoc capabilities. 

* Instance Between updates for sequential segments. Originally, this feature allowed you to match an event in a sequential segment, such as the end of a visit, and to set time within or after logic based on these event checkpoints. Now, a new container-restriction function let you specify a limit and count, and to identify the container in building a segment, allowing you to build more focused and complex sequential segments.
* Dimension Between updates for sequential segments. Like the Instance Between logic that identifies matches between containers, the Dimension Between now includes a dimension-restriction function that provides logic based on dimension values, determining matches based on specific values (table rows) to track if a selected dimension is set (or not) and then allow you to provide segment logic based on these dimension values.
* Sequential segmentation adds multi-instance matching. The previous implementation of Instance Between logic employed only first instance matching for sequential segments, failing to match legitimate sequences found later in the visit. New logic now allows any matching sequence across the visit to be captured as part of the sequential segment. For example, a sequential segment capturing visitors that went to *page A then page B but not page C* would not match if the visitor went to *A to B to C and then back to B*, which matches in a second instance (going back to page B matches the logic *A to B and not C*). 


### Report Builder {#fixes_arb}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue that caused results to not return in report builder in some circumstances when running a multi-level breakdown.
* Fixed an issue in report builder that caused a workbook to return an error when recent data is enabled and the request contains only recent data events.
* Fixed an issue in report builder that prevented file download URLs from being reported in some circumstances for report suites that have enabled case-insensitive props.
* Fixed an issue that caused items to be returned in an inconsistent order in report builder or a data extract with the Most Popular filter applied.

### Data Warehouse {#fixes_data_warehouse}


>[!NOTE]
>
>Data warehouse access from Version 14 will be removed in this release.[Learn more](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/?f=whatsnew_segments) 


### Clickstream Data Feeds {#clickstream}

Data Backfills for Hourly Data Feeds: 

If you request data for earlier dates when setting up a new hourly data feed, data for dates more than 60 days ago might be delivered in daily format instead of hourly. 

In this case, you will not receive 24 separate deliveries for these days, instead, you will receive a single delivery with a midnight timestamp that contains all of the data for that day. If you are requesting this type of backfill, Make sure your ETL is configured to process daily deliveries. 

See [Configuring Data Feeds](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/clickstream/datafeeds_configure.html) for more information. 

### AppMeasurement and Mobile SDKs {#appmeasurement_sdk}

** [!DNL  AppMeasurement] for JavaScript** 

**1.4.3** 

* Made all handling of delayed tracking calls consistent, which fixes issues with backed-up variables during the delay, such as the clicked object.
* Changed to not do automatic referrer tracking after the first tracking call so the 2nd, 3rd, etc tracking call (usually link tracking) will not double-count the referrer when *` s.referrer`* was manually set before the first tracking call.
* The distribution zip was updated to include Visitor API 1.3.5.

**JavaScript H code (Legacy)** 

**H.27.5** 

* Changed to not do automatic referrer tracking after first tracking call so the 2nd, 3rd, etc tracking call (usually link tracking) will not double-count the referrer when *` s.referrer`* was manually set before the first tracking call.
* The distribution zip was updated to include Visitor API 1.3.5

**Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service** 

**1.3.5** 

** [!DNL  AppMeasurement] for Other Platforms** 

See [AppMeasurement Release History](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/release/index.html) the following for a release history of [!DNL  AppMeasurement] on the following platforms:

## [!DNL Social]

**Fixes and Enhancements** 

This [!DNL  Social] release focuses on improved performance, scalability, usability, and reliability. More than 350 back-end fixes and enhancements address these areas. The fixes highlighted below describe resolutions for the more important customer-reported issues. 

* Added a new sub-classification for [!UICONTROL  Owned Post ID] that lets you run a [!UICONTROL  Social Campaigns] report in [!DNL  Adobe Analytics] to view owned social metrics. For example, you can display how many Facebook post impressions were generated by all posts in a campaign.
* Fixed an issue that caused [!DNL  SAINT] classifications to be incorrect after initial [!DNL  Adobe Social] enablement.
* Fixed an issue that incorrectly caused an error message to display after editing a tweet so that it contains fewer than 140 characters.
* Removed the [!UICONTROL  Expand/Collapse] option in the [!UICONTROL  Publisher's] [!UICONTROL  Preview] pane that displays when creating content for Twitter. Because of changes made by Twitter, this option is no longer necessary.
* Fixed an issue that caused reported metric numbers in [!DNL  Social] for YouTube videos to be delayed when compared to the numbers reported on YouTube.
* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented posts made natively and non-natively from displaying in the [!UICONTROL  Post Analytics] report.
* Fixed an issue that caused the reported post time in the [!UICONTROL  Posts] report to differ from the post time in Facebook.
* Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented users from resolving escalations in [!UICONTROL  Moderation].
* Fixed an issue that caused discrepancies for delegations and re-escalations when comparing numbers on the [!UICONTROL  Moderation Overview] dashboard and in the downloaded report.
* Fixed an issue that caused post time stamps in a downloaded moderation report to display in UTC time, rather in the user's time zone.
* [!DNL  Social] now sends email messages when LinkedIn accounts need to be re-authorized.
* Fixed an issue that caused Sina Weibo accounts to require frequent re-authorization.

## [!DNL Target]

* Target Standard and Premium
* Target Classic
* Recommendations Classic
