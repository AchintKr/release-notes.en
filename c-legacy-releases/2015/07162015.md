# Release Notes - July 2015

Learn about new features and fixes in the Adobe Marketing Cloud.

## Core Services

### Marketing Cloud Interface {#marketing_cloud_interface}

Version 15.7 planned release: **July 22, 2015**

* Fixed an issue that prevented attribute descriptions specified on the View/Edit Schema page (in customer attributes) from being updated in Analytics reports. (MAC-25985)
* Fixed an issue preventing the thumbnails from rendering for uploaded assets. (MAC-25863)
* Fixed an issue that prevented new segments created in reports &amp analytics from being available in Marketing Cloud Audiences. (MAC-25817)
* Fixed an issue that prevented audience sharing from Analytics, when using the visitor ID service. (MAC-25788, MAC-25747)
* Added support for multibyte characters in customer attributes. (MAC-25552)

**Known Issue** 

A known issue is causing duplicate auto-generated accounts to be created in Audience Manager, and automatically linking them to a user's Marketing Cloud identity. This issue occurs if you attempt to navigate to Audience Manager before linking your accounts. Adobe recommends that you link your Audience Manager accounts to the Marketing Cloud before navigating to Audience Manager. (MAC-25640) 

See [Marketing Cloud Product Documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/about-core-services/core-services-landing.html) for product help.
