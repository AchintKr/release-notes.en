  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>


>[!NOTE]
>
>Starting with the May 2015 maintenance release, the option to launch Ad Hoc Analysis directly from within a report in Reports &amp [!DNL Analytics] will be removed.

### Marketing Reports &amp; [!DNL Analytics] {#fixes_reports_analytics}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with the compare date range settings for a dashboard having to be manually reset. Note that this fix works only for new bookmarks; existing ones will need to be opened and *`saved as`*.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the [!UICONTROL  Item-specific Summary] report to be created in PDF format.
* Fixed an issue with the opt-out links in *`Exclude by Cookie/IP Address`* not working.
* Fixed an issue with non-admin users not being able to access a summary report by clicking on a line item. This issue happened after a breakdown of the [!UICONTROL  Pages Report] by *`devices`*.

### Data Warehouse {#fixes_data_warehouse}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed a discrepancy between Reports & [!DNL Analytics] and data warehouse data by adding support for *`campaign instances`* as a segmentation metric to data warehouse.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data warehouse access from Version 14 has been removed.[Learn more](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/components/segmentation/whats-new-segmentation.html) 

### [!DNL Analytics] Web Services (SOAP and REST APIs) {#analytics_web_svcs}

**Improvements and Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with ` averageTimeSpentOnSite`, where returns were showing identical data despite using different page titles (evar13) in segmentation.
* The Reporting API now allows correlations. The elements returned from ` Report.GetElements` now have information about what breakdown types are supported for that element. This improves data matching between report builder and reports &amp; analytics.
