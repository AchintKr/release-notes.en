## Core Services

### Adobe Mobile Services {#mobile}

The [!DNL  Adobe Mobile Services] June 18, 2015 release includes the following changes: 

**Feature Access Change** 

Customers must have [!DNL  Analyticsâ€”Mobile Apps] or [!DNL  Analytics Premium] in order to use the following functionality: 

* In-app Messaging
* Acquisition Campaign Tracking
* Points of Interest Analytics

Customers with [!DNL  Analytics Standard] or other analytics point products (such as [!DNL  SiteCatalyst]) will be grand-fathered in to current functionality until renewal. 

[!DNL  Analytics] core customers will not have this functionality. 

**Fixes and Enhancements** 

* Expiration for tracking acquisition campaigns changed from visit to visitor for all customers. This change facilitates campaign attribution to post download activity to the visitor for all visits instead of just the first visit.

### Reports &amp; Analytics Fixes {#fixes_reports_analytics}

* Fixed an issue that resulted in an error when trying to download a [!UICONTROL  Last Touch Channel] report that included a date comparison and a calculated metric.
* Fixed an issue that occurred when trying to create the *`item specific summary`* campaign details report in PDF format.
* Fixed a display error in [!UICONTROL  Admin Tools]. When a user was deleted, the console showed that he or she was deleted by that same user.
* Fixed an issue that caused an instance of an eVar to be incremented if the value of the eVar was deleted or set it to *`blank`*, using processing rules.

### Ad Hoc Analysis Fixes {#fixes_ad_hoc}

* Fixed an issue around report emails ( [!DNL  .xls] and [!DNL  .csv] attachments) that contained the report suite ID instead of the report suite name in the email. It now shows the report suite name.

### Data Workbench Fixes {#fixes_data_workbench}

* Propensity score was not resetting when rerunning different inputs in the same workspace. This now resets properly.
* An issue causing no countable dimensions to be available when first opening the Correlation Matrix has been fixed.
* Export of Target segments were failing because the *`mboxPC`* field was missing. This is now fixed.
* ID request formatted correctly. Using the *`mbox3rdpartyId`* identification instead of default PCIDs caused [!UICONTROL  Adobe Target] to reject requests generated via the Target/Data Workbench integration (using the [!DNL  ExportIntegration.exe]). This ID request is now being formatted correctly and throughput is successful.
* A Report Server memory leak when exporting to Excel has been fixed.

### Data Warehouse Fixes {#fixes_data_warehouse}

* Segments: Added data warehouse support for *`event-exists`* operator for non-event metrics.
* Segments: Added support for the *`not-event-exists`* operator.
* Segments: Added support for *`timerange*`*.
* Made changes to Visit Time/Site Time business logic: 

    * Use *`visit_start_time_gmt`* as the starting time of a visit. Now visits that started before the reporting date range are not negatively impacted.
    * Added a new breakdown category *`Group L: No duration`* to classify visits that span zero seconds. Now these visits are no longer included in the *`Group A: <1 minute`* time bucket.
    * Transactional data source hits (hit_source=7) are no longer assumed to have a Visit duration.
    * Time-stamped hits that are designated a timestamp earlier than *`visit_start_time_gmt`* have absolute value applied to the time delta so they will not always automatically be categorized as *`Group A: <1 minute`*.


>[!NOTE]
>
>Data warehouse access from Version 14 has been removed.[Learn more](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/components/segmentation/whats-new-segmentation.html) 

### AppMeasurement and Mobile SDKs {#appmeasurement_sdk}

<!-- <p>https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/omtrcache/Visitor+API+Release+Log </p> -->
**Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service** 

**Version 1.5** 

* Authenticated state support. Along with the Marketing Cloud Visitor ID, the Visitor API accepts multiple Customer IDs for the same visitor along with a customer type identifier, to separate the scope of the different Customer IDs and *`authStates`*.
* Removed deprecated support for Audience Manager DPID mappings to Customer ID Types used in *`setCustomerIDs`*.

**Version 1.5** 

* Support for Visitor API 1.5, which uses the *`getCustomerIDs`* method to gather Customer IDs and authenticated state, and sends the IDs in with data collection requests.

**[!DNL  AppMeasurement] for Other Platforms** 

See [AppMeasurement Release History](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/release/index.html) the following for a release history of [!DNL  AppMeasurement] on the following platforms:

**Fixes and Enhancements** 

This [!DNL  Social] release focuses on improved performance, scalability, usability, and reliability.  The fixes highlighted below describe resolutions for the more important customer-reported issues. 

* Enhanced the publishing workflow to include a reminder when you click [!UICONTROL  Post Now] that lists the names of the properties to which you are posting content.
* Renamed the [!UICONTROL  Approve Now] button to [!UICONTROL  Bypass Approvals] to clarify the behavior. Clicking [!UICONTROL  Bypass Approvals] uses the override permission.
* Enhanced the spell-check function in the [!UICONTROL  Publisher] to ignore shortened links and underline misspellings as expected.
* Fixed an issue with the [!UICONTROL  Post Analytics] report that caused filters to not respect selected page groups.
* Fixed an issue that caused the [!UICONTROL  Download] and [!UICONTROL  Send] functions on the [!UICONTROL  Post Analytics] report to not function.
* Fixed an issue that caused an error when accessing the Post Details report for a YouTube video.
* Fixed an issue that caused discrepancies between the number of [!UICONTROL  Page Engagements] reported in the [!UICONTROL  Properties] report and in its downloaded file.
* Fixed an issue that caused data in the [!UICONTROL  Properties] report and in its downloaded file to be off by one day.
* Fixed an issue with the [!UICONTROL  Classification] filter in the [!UICONTROL  Social Buzz] report that caused no results to be returned.
* Fixed an issue that prevented tracking codes from appending to Facebook album posts.
* Fixed an issue that sometimes caused posts to fail due to timeout errors.
* Fixed an issue that prevented moderation-workflow assignees from displaying in Internet Explorer 11 browsers.
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from creating listening rules for WordPress that contain an OR operator.
