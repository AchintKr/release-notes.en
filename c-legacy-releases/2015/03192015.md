### Dynamic Tag Management (03/24/2015) {#dtm}

**Fixes** 

* Updated the variable and event interface for the [!DNL  Adobe Analytics] tool to allow auto-complete selection and to enable access to additional eVars and events for [!DNL  Analytics Premium] accounts.
* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL  Store Path] option for FTP library deployments was not updating for production libraries when using nested directories.
* Updated data elements to support hyphened names.
* Fixed an issue where the column indicator in the [!UICONTROL  Rules] table displayed for a rule, even if the tool was deleted.
* Updated the [!UICONTROL  Sequential HTML] code option to be available for page-load rules only. This option no longer appears for event-based rules. A notice displays with a [!UICONTROL  Sequential HTML] tag on an event-based rule to notify users to change the tag before the rule can be saved.
* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL  Sign in with Adobe ID] login option wasnâ€™t allowing users to sign in as a different user. Users can click [!UICONTROL  Sign in with a Different Adobe ID] to log out as the current [!DNL  Marketing Cloud] user and be redirected to the Adobe login page.

### Marketing Reports &amp; Analytics {#fixes_reports_analytics}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue where the **[!UICONTROL  Select All]** checkbox in **[!UICONTROL  Segment Manager]** selected more segments than expected when a filter was applied. It now selects only the visible, active segments.
* Fixed an issue where breaking down the [!UICONTROL  Servers] report by *` Site Sections`* or *` Page Names`* returned a [!UICONTROL  Top Level Domains] report instead.
* Fixed an issue with alerts for mobile reports (Device Name, Device Type, Manufacturer, etc.) not working properly. 
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This fix requires that you recreate all alerts for mobile reports.
* Fixed an issue where in password recovery emails, Adobeâ€™s sender domain (omniture.com) did not match the *` From`* value (adobe.com). This resulted in these emails being blocked and never received by the user. The *` From`* value has been changed to [!DNL  httpd@omniture.com].


### Report Builder {#fixes_arb}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with the Visits metric not showing up in the [!UICONTROL  Available Metric] list on the second page of the [!UICONTROL  Request Wizard] in Report Builder.


### Ad Hoc Analysis {#fixes_ad_hoc}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with *` hour`* granularity that showed different results depending on whether it was set to *` Rows`* or *` Columns`*.

### Data Warehouse {#fixes_data_warehouse}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with data warehouse reports not getting delivered when the email address was set as the clients company's email address in the From field. All data warehouse reports are now sent from [!DNL  no-reply@omniture.com].


>[!NOTE]
>
>Data warehouse access from Version 14 has been removed.[Learn more](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/?f=whatsnew_segments) 


### Clickstream Data Feeds {#clickstream}


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The following data feed column sizes will increase in a future release (no sooner than 3 months from now):


* geo_zip field - column size will increase from 16 to 50 bytes.
* geo_region field - column size will increase from 32 to 255 bytes.
* geo_city field - column size will increase from 32 to 255 bytes.

## Social

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* Effective March 1, 2015, [!DNL  Adobe Social] will no longer support geo-targeting of tweets. Twitter requires that all geo-targeting leverage the Ads API. We are working with Twitter to reintroduce geo-targeting at a later date. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. Please reach out to your Social Account Manager or Customer Success/Support representative if you have additional questions.
* Fixed an issue that temporarily prevented [!DNL  Social] from collecting metrics for YouTube channels.
* A one-time Facebook Publisher Authorization page will be triggered upon log in asking customers, who are currently using a Facebook custom publisher app, to authorize the [!DNL  Adobe Social] new publisher app for each user's linked Facebook account(s). This is required for when we upgrade to the new Facebook graph API in April.
* Fixed an issue that caused metric discrepancies between those reported in [!DNL  Adobe Analytics]and in YouTube for owned social properties.
