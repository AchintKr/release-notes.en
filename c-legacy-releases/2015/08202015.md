### Dynamic Tag Management {#dtm}

Release date: July 13, 2015 

Adobe has deprecated the use of Amazon S3 as a DTM library hosting option. 

See [What's New in Dynamic Tag Management](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/dtm/using/whatsnew.html) for current and cumulative release notes, help, and documentation updates. 

* [New Features in [!DNL Analytics]](../../c-legacy-releases/2015/08202015.md#features_analytics) **(Updated 8/21/2015):** The deprecated SFTP key (communicated publicly in the Fall of 2013) used for transferring data warehouse reports and data feeds was permanently removed. 

  Please contact Client Care to obtain a new SFTP key. Note that Adobe now supports both RSA and DSA keys (since not all SFTP implementations support one or the other). (AN-102692)

### Reports &amp; Analytics Fixes {#fixes_reports_analytics}

* Updated the Classification Rule Builder with the [Select Report Suites and Variables](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/components/classifications/classifications-rulebuilder/classification-rule-definitions.html) panel. This panel lets you add report suites and variables to an existing rule set. Previously, you specified the variable and report suite while creating the rule set. This change prevents reported issues occurring with classification variables.
* Fixed a permissions issue that occurred when creating and editing segments. (AN-106175)
* Fixed an issue that occurred when a user, after checking “Remember Me” on the login page, logged in and tried to modify a report that was sent via a link. This resulted in an “Access Denied” error. (AN-89504 + AN-107008)
* Fixed an issue with hourly alerts not working properly on calculated metrics reports. (AN-105946)
* Fixed an issue with the View All Reports search feature not working in IE 11. (AN-104672 + AN-102566)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the use of special characters (UTF-8 and multi-byte) in processing rules. (AN-102095)
* Fixed an issue where the Product View metric was missing from the Product report. (AN-106692)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the scheduling of reports with a delivery frequency of Yearly. (AN-105562)
* Fixed an issue that prevented scheduled dashboards with multi-byte characters from getting delivered. (AN-106309)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the Segment and User Management interfaces from loading. (AN-106627)
* Fixed an issue that caused Segment Details to not be displayed. (AN-105185)
* Fixed an issue with hourly alerts getting triggered incorrectly. (AN-97573 + AN-105946)
* Fixed an issue that resulted in an error when creating targets that contained calculated metrics. (AN-104410)
* Fixed an issue with calculated metrics in trended reports. (AN-105606)
* Fixed an issue with daily alerts not matching the values shown in the Key Metrics report. (AN-105953)

### Ad Hoc Analysis Fixes {#fixes_ad_hoc}

* Fixed an issue that prevented users from sharing segments with certain other users in the Ad Hoc Analysis Segment Manager. (AN-105679)
* Fixed an issue that occurred after the name (not the definition) of a calculated metric was changed and this resulted in different values being returned. (AN-106214)
* Fixed an issue with Ad Hoc reports not loading properly when using "Time" as the metric type. (AN-105806)
* Fixed an issue with hierarchy views not reporting data. (AN-103234)
* Fixed an issue with the Ad Hoc Analysis Segment Builder not offering “Minute” as a Within option in sequential segmentation. (AN-105632)
* Fixed an issue with statistics in Ad Hoc Analysis when report dimensions are used. (AN-105864)

### Data Warehouse Fixes {#fixes_data_warehouse}

* Fixed a Transactional Data Source data discrepancy between Reports &amp Analytics and Data Warehouse, regarding metric calculations for entry pages. (AN-102263)
* Fixed an issue where some hits were not getting proper participation credit. (AN-106759)
* Fixed an issue where applying a segment containing classifications for the First/Last Touch Channel report to a data warehouse report did not retrieve any data. (AN-89294)
* Fixed an issue that caused crashes on column values larger than 2KB in size. (AN-106201, AN-106850)
* Fixed a Tableau file issue where the [!DNL  .csv] file extension was not added when *`.csv`* was part of the file name. (AN-106466)
* Fixed an issue with Tableau files’ UTF-8 string handling in unicode fields. (AN-106467)

### Clickstream Data Feed Fixes {#clickstream}

* **Update notice:** We are updating our data feed delivery infrastructure. We are adding additional IP addresses to the pool that we already use to deliver data feeds. If you have IP white list on your FTP sites that data feeds are delivering to, you will need to add these additional IP addresses to that white list. 
    * London: 185.34.189.0/27, addition scheduled August 13, 2015
    * Oakland: 192.243.248.32/27, addition scheduled August 20, 2015
    * Dallas: 66.235.153.96/27, addition scheduled August 27, 2015

* When using Amazon S3 to deliver data, a newly implemented [!UICONTROL BucketOwnerFullControl] feature assigns permission for cross-account uploads, making it possible for a user to create objects in a bucket that belong to a completely different account. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) account owner creates a bucket, creates a user with permissions to create objects in the bucket, and then provides credentials for another user to create objects. See [Configuring Data Feeds](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/clickstream/datafeeds_configure.html) for complete information on this feature. 

### AppMeasurement and Mobile SDKs {#appmeasurement_sdk}

**Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service** 

**Version 1.5.1** 

* Fixed a bug to prevent the [!UICONTROL Visitor ID Service] from requesting an iframe if there's no data to synchronize or fire. (AAM-20164)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the [!UICONTROL Visitor ID Service] from properly setting a multi-part, top-level domain cookie. For example, if you have a domain like ` my_company.co.uk`, under some circumstances, the [!UICONTROL Visitor ID Service] would set a cookie in ` co.uk` only. (AN-104683) 

  This only affected a few clients that met *all* of the following criteria: 

    * Using the Visitor ID Service.
    * Enabled a grace period *or* are using first-party cookies and users block third-party cookies.
    * Have pages with multi-part, top-level domains.

**Known Issues** 

[!DNL  Analytics] and [!DNL  Target] customers may experience latency increases after implementing the [!UICONTROL Visitor ID Service].

* Inclusion of Visitor API 1.5.1

**JavaScript H code (Legacy)** 

**Version H.27.5**

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* Fixed a bug with Firefox that prevented you from setting a start date for sending segments to a destination. (AAM-15785)
* Fixed a bug in [!UICONTROL Trait Builder] that prevented the code view from displaying trait components properly when switching between [!UICONTROL Expression Builder] and [!UICONTROL Code View]. (AAM-15919, AAM-20121)
* Fixed a bug in [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace] that let you model a data feed even when it was not enabled for modeling. (AAM-16495)
* In the basic information for a destination, the [!UICONTROL Data Export] labels show user-friendly names for the export controls applied to the destination. (AAM-19824)
* Fixed multiple [!UICONTROL Segment Builder] bugs that prevented it from: 
    * Returning updated segment size data after editing a segment. (AAM-15809)
    * Returning trait sizes for 30-day intervals. (AAM-15982)
    * Recalculating the estimated segment size when building a complex rule. (AAM-20265)
* Fixed multiple [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace] bugs: 
    * Data buyers no longer see test or demo subscriber accounts. (AAM-11819)
    * The Venn diagram for a subscribed feed shows the overlap between your segment and the provider's segment as a frequency count instead of a %. (AAM-20495)

**New and Revised Documentation** 

* New documentation describes how to bring data from a Google Doubleclick Campaign Manager (DCM) account into [!DNL  Audience Manager]. See [Import DCM Files Into Audience Manager](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/t_dcmlogs.html).
* New documentation describes how to work with the [!UICONTROL Bulk Management Tools]. See [Bulk Management Tools](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_bulk.html) for more information.
* Revised the [Master Marketing Profile Integration](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_mmp.html) to update the context data variable. This variable is supposed to end with an underscore. Previously, it was shown ending with a period.

**Known Issues** 

[!DNL  Analytics] customers need to set an integration code when using the [Master Marketing Profile](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_mmp.html) and passing declared IDs to [!DNL  Audience Manager] with the Visitor ID Service.
