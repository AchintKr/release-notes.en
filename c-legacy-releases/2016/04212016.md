   <td colname="col2"> <p>Sometime between the February and March Maintenance Releases, the following Analytics data processing change was implemented: </p> <p>Previously, when using the Product variable without having an event set, the event would default to "ProdView", set early in processing (before processing rules take effect). The event is now set after the processing rules to avoid conflicts with how mobile data processing works. This change has the following downstream effects:

      <li id="li_A18A2DAE2A97440D977A745E7C99404E"><p>ProdViews are no longer inflated because of hits where context data is generating events (especially in Mobile).

      <li id="li_75F4B73AE98241E3A900A526460CD70D"><p>Any VISTA rule that has logic depending on a ProdView event being set on a hit might need to be reviewed to see if changes to the VISTA rule are needed. This is because ProdView events might be set on fewer hits than they previously were, because ProdView is set earlier in the processing pipeline. This change may or may not impact what is desired from the VISTA rule. </p></li>
