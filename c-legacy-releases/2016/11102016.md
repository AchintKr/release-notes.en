### Marketing Cloud ID Service {#mcvid}

Release date: **November 10, 2016**

**Updated (1/6/2017)** This release increments the ID service code to version 1.10. It includes the following features, bug fixes, and other changes. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>>
>* Version 1.10 requires [!UICONTROL  AppMeasurement] 1.8.0.
>* Using Marketing Cloud ID service Library 2.0.0+, ID synching will begin for Adobe Advertising Cloud by default. See [Understanding ID Synchronization and Match Rates](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-match-rates.html).

* Added ` Visitor.overwriteCrossDomainMCIDAndAID`, a boolean function that lets you overwrite the [!DNL  Marketing Cloud] and [!DNL  Analytics] IDs on other domains that you own. (MCID-218)
* Added ` TS = *`UTC timestamp`*`as a property of the ` visitor.appendVisitorIDsTo` function. The ID service uses the timestamp to determine if it should use the IDs in the redirect URL based on a 5-minute aging interval. See [Append Visitor ID Function](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-appendvisitorid.html). (MCID-219)
* Added ` Visitor.getLocationHint`, a new function that returns a region ID. (MCID-227)
* Added ` idSyncByURL` and ` idSyncByDataSource`, 2 functions that let you manually implement an ID sync in the [!UICONTROL  Destination Publishing iFrame]. (MCID-166)
* Fixed a bug that blocked the AppMeasurement tracking call if ` disableThirdPartyCalls:true`. (MCID-223)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the ID service from passing the [!DNL  Marketing Cloud] ID (MID) across different domains. (MCID-215)
See [Marketing Cloud ID Services](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/) product documentation.
