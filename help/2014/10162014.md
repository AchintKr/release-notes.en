## Dynamic Tag Management {#section_9E3769FBDCD8476692F763ECAFD2F3B8}

New features in dynamic tag management released on October 28, 2014:

   </tr> 
  </tbody> 
 </tgroup> 
</table>

**Fixes and Improvements**

* Fixed an issue where the Tracking Server value automatically determined by dynamic tag management for the `keyword  Adobe Analytics` tool sometimes set an incorrect value.
* Fixed an issue where a restored data element had the name appended with "(Restored)," which caused previous references to that data element to be broken. (The appended value is now added only if restoring the data element would create a naming conflict with an existing data element.)
* Fixed an issue caused when triggering an event-based rule on a click event. If the click event had a delay link activation on an anchor tag with no HREF, the issue forced the browser to attempt to navigate to a blank HREF location.
* Fixed an issue where dynamic tag management was no longer saving global variables configured in an Analytics tool when changes to that tool had been rejected and then restored.
* Implemented significant performance improvements in the library generation process, which should result in a shorter wait for changes to appear in production, especially during peak usage hours.
* Fixed an issue where company administrators were unable to export their activity log to CSV when there was a large amount of data present.
* Added the ability to use custom HTML data attributes with CSS selector-based data elements.

**Fixes**

In addition to the new features and enhancements described above, fixes in `keyword  Social` 3.3.5 focus on improved performance, scalability, usability, and reliability. More than 525 back-end fixes and enhancements address these areas. The fixes highlighted below describe resolutions for the more important customer-reported issues.

* Fixed two export issues with the downloaded `wintitle  Posts` report. The first issue caused only one Facebook post link to display in the export even though two links were specified. The second issue prevented Google+ post links from displaying in separate rows, one row for each link.
* Fixed an issue that prevented the downloaded `wintitle  Post` report from honoring filter settings.
* Fixed an issue that caused an error when filtering templates by `wintitle  Tags` in the `wintitle  Publisher`.
* Fixed an issue that caused an error when filtering templates by `wintitle  Post Type` in the `wintitle  Publisher`.
* Fixed an issue that caused the type-ahead, auto-fill feature for tags in the `wintitle  Publisher` to not function as expected.
* Fixed an issue that caused group posts to a large number of pages to fail.
* Fixed an issue that caused problems when using hash tags in the `wintitle  Publisher`. Suggestions were not provided and hash tags failed to display in the post.
* Fixed an issue that prevented bit.ly links from adding campaign tracking codes to published posts even though they had an assigned campaign.
* Fixed an issue that caused the first message in Facebook private message conversations to not display on the `wintitle  Content Details` page.
* Fixed an issue in `wintitle  Unified Moderation` that caused URLs in retweets to be truncated if the expanded retweet exceeded the character limit.
