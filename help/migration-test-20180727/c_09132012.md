## DataWarehouse - Updated 9/21/2012 {#datawarehouse}

The following fixes and enhancements are available for `DataWarehouse`: 

* Resolved an issue where requests were being limited to 50 rows by default.
* Resolved a number of issues related to how `DataWarehouse` handles the following situations in the product list. `DataWarehouse` matches `SiteCatalyst` rules for these situations: 
    * Ignores empty products, such as a comma "," with no additional data.
    * Ignores product entities that are a single dash ("-").
    * Properly parses product events that contain tabs or newline characters.
    * Ignores instances of event "0", but continues parsing the product list rather than terminating the parse.
    * Skips situations with event values where an equal sign is missing. Parsing now continues rather than terminating.
    * Trims only spaces rather than all whitespace characters.
    * No longer trims spaces if the space is preceded by a backslash.

* Resolved an issue where using a classification as a segment criteria was not working properly if the classification was for a merchandising eVar. Specifically, segment criteria such as `where classification is not null` was not working for merchandising eVars.
* Resolved an issue where using a classification as a segment criteria was not working properly, if the classification was for certain visit-reporting dimensions (such as Entry Page, Exit Page, and so on).
* Resolved an issue occurring when using multiple segment containers in a segment. The containers were not being connected correctly by *OR* conditions.

## ReportBuilder 4.3 Maintenance Release - Updated 9/15/2012 {#reportbuilder}

The `ReportBuilder` 4.3 maintenance release (09/15/12) includes the following fixes: 

* In Advanced Delivery Options, we added the ability to specify *minutes* for scheduled report delivery.
* Fixed an issue in the `Request Manager` that caused the date range preset to revert to the value of *Today*.
* Added support for list variables 1 - 5 in the reporting API, to match the `SiteCatalyst` 15 interface.
* Fixed a formula calculation issue occurring when opening a workbook for a delivered report.
For more information, see the [ReportBuilder Help System](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/arb/index.html). 

## SiteCatalyst 15.4 Maintenance Release {#sitecatalyst}

The `SiteCatalyst` 15.4 maintenance release (09/13/12) includes the following enhancements and fixes: 
**Fixes:** 

* Fixed an issue that occasionally caused funnel reports with a filter applied to show no data when displayed in a dashboard. This issue occurred only after the date range was modified.
* Fixed an issue that caused file corruption in compressed Excel report downloads in Internet Explorer 8.
* Fixed an issue that prevented global calculated metrics from being selected in mobile reports.
* Fixed an issue that prevented some calculated metrics from being selected on reports. `SiteCatalyst` now evaluates all calculated metrics when loading the `Metric Selector` and allows you to select any calculated metrics that are valid for the report.
* When displaying a report that has a segment applied to which the user does not have access (for example, a shared bookmark to a report with an unshared segment), the UI now displays "unknown segment" rather than a blank segment name
* Fixed an issue that prevented Page Filters in the `Clickmap Report` from being displayed in the `Choose Page` window.
* Fixed an issue on the `Referrers Report` that caused Typed/Bookmarked referrers to display on this report as "Unspecified". This report now contains only non-Typed/Bookmarked referrers similar to SiteCatalyst 14.
* Fixed an issue that Caused the `Time Spent on Page Report` to show zero data after switching to a trended view.

## SiteCatalyst 14.9 Maintenance Release {#sitecatalyst14}

The `SiteCatalyst` 14.9 maintenance release (09/13/12) includes the following enhancements and fixes: 
**Fixes:** 

* Removed an internal check that prevented traffic and commerce metrics from being added in separate columns in `DataExtracts` and `ExcelClient`.
* Fixed an issue that caused `DataExtracts` on the `Search Keywords - All Report` to return only line items with more than 5 instances.

## AppMeasurement & Mobile {#appmeasurement}

**JavaScript AppMeasurement** 
**H.25.1** 

* Forced URL encoding for the following characters: 
  ```
  ~
  !
  *
  (
  )
  '
  ```
  This resolves issues with un-escaped characters being stored in the `ClickMap` `s_sq` cookie.
* Fixed an issue that might cause the video complete event to not be sent when using a custom `media.monitor` method that tracks the media close event: 
  ```
  If(media.event=="CLOSE") {
  ...
  }
  
  ```
