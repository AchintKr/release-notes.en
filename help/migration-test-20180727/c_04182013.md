## DataWarehouse {#section_178051456D0847FAA6BF6B0B3E453D6B}

The ` DataWarehouse` 15.4 maintenance release (04/18/2013) includes the following changes: 
**New Features** 

<table id="table_BC25FB3C520C46CD89F0C3E4524E10FA"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Feature </th>

   <td colname="col2"> <p>The Page URL is available for current and historical reports.</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

**Fixes** 

* Values that contained a double backslash were not being classified. This occurred in some environments where MySQL was escaping backslash characters with an additional backslash. These values are now classified correctly.
* Fixed performance issues when loading large numbers of segments that caused the ` DataWarehouse` UI to load slowly.

## ReportBuilder 4.3 Maintenance Release {#section_CD395EB3EDA54D448312C9CDAC0E9B9F}

The ` ReportBuilder` 4.3 maintenance release (04/18/2013) includes the following changes: 
**New Features** 

|  Feature  | |
|---|---|
|  Feedback Survey  | We added a survey that displays when you launch ` ReportBuilder`, and every 90 days thereafter. The survey lets you provide feedback to help improve ` ReportBuilder`.  |

**Fixes** 

* Added the Searches metric to the ` Search Engine Report` break-downs.
* Fixed an issue preventing traffic sources from fully subrelating, as they do in ` SiteCatalyst` 15. For example, ` ReportBuilder` was not letting you run a ` Natural Search Engines Report`, and then subrelate it using dimensions in Site Sections.
* Added commerce events to geography reports.
* Added social and video metrics to more reports.

## Discover 3.1 Maintenance Release {#section_075C41360D474CB5AC23F38597F4D30C}

The ` Discover` 3.1 maintenance release (04/18/2013) includes the following changes: 
**Fixes** 

* The ` Apple Mac` and ` Java 7` incompatibilities have been resolved. ` Mac` running ` Java 7` is now launching and running ` Discover`.
* ` Discover` now allows for a 64-bit value for a single value for a single hit. The previous value was 32-bit. 
  In practice, revenue conversions across currencies require larger individual values. For example, a 32-bit value can hold an assigned value of up to 2,147,483,648. Because two digits are required for decimal values (such as cents for dollars), the remaining maximum can only reach 21,474,836 as a single revenue value. The change to 64-bit now allows for much larger individual values required for global currency evaluations.

* ` Discover` 1.5 is deprecated and will no longer be available or supported after April 18th, 2013.
* Clicking Save after building a ` Calculated Metric` or renaming a ` Metric` or ` Segment` returned an error. This has been fixed.
* Reports Suites set to "Restricted Access" were appearing in ` Discover`. These hidden report suites are no longer visible from the ` Discover` user interface and now correspond to report suites listed in ` SiteCatalyst`.
* Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files generated from the ` Discover` 3.2 release in May will include the following updates: 

    * In data, the number of digits after the decimal will match what is displayed in the ` Discover` user interface. For example: - Percentages will have 2 decimal places by default, and
      - Calculated metrics will have the specified number of decimal places (default of 2).

    * In text (such as page names), the backslash character is no longer being removed. For example \*new*\ was being rendered as *new*.
    * In data, NaN (not a number) now renders as "NaN". This was previously rendered as a zero.
    * Header changed from ` SiteCatalyst` to ` Discover`.
    * Header now includes updated copyright message.
