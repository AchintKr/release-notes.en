This release fixes the following issues:

* Under certain conditions, profile export targeting rules were being deleted.
* When editing reusable segments, changes were saved even if ** ` Cancel` ** was clicked in the ` Save` dialog box.
* The default sort order for date options in the ` Campaigns List` has been changed so newest items display first.
* When a segment was added, the ` Campaign Edit` page scrolled to the top. It now remains on the Segments section of the page.
* Fixed a date discrepancy in Daily Results on dates when the DST time change occurs reported by customers in certain time zones.
* Social target from Twitter was including visitors from Pinterest.
* When report values were digits or more, the values were returned in scientific notation in the API. Small numbers were still recorded as normal integers. This caused problems when clients pulled data from the APIs programmatically and tried to perform the same actions across all the data in the API, only to find out after that the format changes.
* If you unchecked a deleted experience from the graph and then changed anything on the reports (date range, segments, success metric, and so on), the unchecked experiences did not stay unchecked.
* New campaigns had "Today" as their default date range instead of "Life of Campaign."
* When the name or description of a saved segment was changed, the changes were not saved. Other properties saved as expected.
* REST profile passing requests also ran through the normal mbox processing path, slowing down the passing of profiles.


## Social 2.2 {#section_5E288B77B5FB4BF089B73DE7CA0F85EC}

The ` Social` 2.2 release includes the following new features and enhancements: 

|  Feature  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Reports: Campaign Details report  | While viewing the ` Campaigns` &gt; ` Campaigns` report, you can access a post-level report with more information about each tracking code.  |
|  Reports: Filter Post Analytics report by audiences  | Filter the ` Post Analytics` report by audiences.  |
|  Publish: Facebook cover photo  | Post or update a cover photo on Facebook pages that you manage. You can post the cover photo immediately or according to schedule.  |
|  Publish: bitly link shorteners  | Create multiple bitly accounts within ` Social` and generate shortened bitly URLs in posts instead of using the default ` Social` link shortener.  |
|  Publish: Narrow audience  | Narrow an existing audience while creating a Facebook post.  |
|  Publish: RSS feeds for Audience posts.  | RSS feeds are available for all audience posts.  |
|  Applications: Mobile support  | Newly created and existing page applications display appropriately on mobile devices.  |
|  Applications: Coupon template  | Create and configure ` Coupon` page applications in the ` Application Builder`.  |
|  Applications: Video Player element  | Play Vimeo videos in page applications. Previously, you could only play YouTube videos.  |
|  Applications: Contest Carousel element  | Sort images in the carousel by oldest images first, images with the fewest votes first, or display images in random order. Previously, you could sort images only by recent images first or by images with the most votes first.  |
|  Applications: Include external files in page applications  | Include external JavaScript or CSS style sheets in your page applications.  |
|  Engage: Moderate tweets from the Social Intelligence report  | Access the ` Social` ` Twitter Moderation` module from individual tweets on the ` Social Intelligence` report.  |
|  Accounts: Disqus and Tumblr support  | Use ` Social` to track terms on Disqus and Tumblr.  |
|  Accounts: Adding terms in bulk  | Add terms that you want to track using a streamlined workflow from inside of ` Social` instead of using ` SAINT`.  |
|  UI and documentation localization  | The user interface for all modules have been localized in the additional languages available from the ` Language Selector`. The documentation has been localized and is available for the Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Korean languages. Documentation for additional languages is in the final stages of localization and will be available in the near future.  |
|  UI improvements in the ` Listening` module  | Although Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean were previously supported by the ` Listening` module, some user interface issue were reported. Reportlets and widgets should now provide the expected results for languages that do not use spaces to delimit words and terms.  |
|  Sentiment analysis for the Japanese language  | Sentiment analysis for the Japanese language is currently in Beta testing. This feature will be enhanced and sentiment analysis will improve during the course of the Beta.  |
|  Documentation Updates  | Added a new topic to provide detailed information about changes to the *Social User Guide*.  |

* Fixed an issue that allowed users to enter non-numeric characters is numeric fields (900px rather than 900).

## SiteCatalyst 15.4 Maintenance Release {#section_1D541E61C8B84F36B8C89B9F0E977E0B}

The ` SiteCatalyst` 15.4 maintenance release (01/17/2013) includes the following improvements:

**Fixes:** 

* A permissions issue prevented some users from accessing ` Target` reports, even when assigned the correct privileges.
* New segments created on a dashboard did not appear in the ` Segmentation` drop-down list until a refresh, even though the segment was created and saved correctly.
* A data discrepancy was displayed between the top items on the ` Referring Domains Report` and the line items in the report for the week that a report suite was upgraded to ` SiteCatalyst` 15
* A breakdown based on an unspecified value in a classification displayed all classification values, rather than only values specific to the selected line item.
* Some line item values did not appear for selection in the ` Fallout Builder`, even when the values appeared in the variable report.
* Line item totals were not displayed on the ` Geosegmentation Regions Report`.
* On dashboards that were migrated from ` SiteCatalyst` 14 to ` SiteCatalyst` 15, some notes were not displaying in the printed version of the report.
* Legends were not displayed on bar charts in dashboards.
* Correlations launched from the ` Mobile Devices Report` were limited to a maximum of 50 items. All report items now display in these reports.
* Some users were unable to view breakdowns on the ` Mobile` reports, even when assigned the correct privileges.
* The ` Compare Dates` feature did not work on ` Mobile` breakdown reports.
* Added Instances as an available metric in the Server, Site Section, Visitor State, and Visitor ZIP/Postal Code reports.
* Traffic reports with daily granularity displayed different values in some circumstances for the carts metric in ` ReportBuilder` and ` SiteCatalyst`.
* Detail reports opened by clicking a referrer on the ` Referring Domains Report` showed results for referrers that do not match the selected referrer. Now only the selected referrer shows results on these detail reports.
* In the ` Browser Type Report`, some calculated metrics did not display in the trended view, but displayed correctly in the ranked view. Calculated metrics now display correctly in both views.
* When editing conversion variable expiration settings with multiple reports suite selected, variables with custom expiration lengths displayed "Day" instead of the custom length. These variables now display the custom expiration length.
* Changed the Total Visits on the ` Visits Report` to display the total for the month listed in the heading. This row previously displayed 4 weeks of data and matched the totals row at the bottom of the report.

## SiteCatalyst 14.9 Maintenance Release {#section_0B24C16DC769418FA51C592463A47DEC}

The ` SiteCatalyst` 14.9 maintenance release (01/17/2013) includes the following improvements: 

* The ` Compare Dates` feature did not work on ` Mobile` breakdown reports.
* When editing conversion variable expiration settings with multiple reports suite selected, variables with custom expiration lengths displayed "Day" instead of the custom length. These variables now display the custom expiration length.

## AppMeasurement & Mobile {#appmeasurement}

` AppMeasurement` libraries for all platforms except JavaScript are now hosted on [ Developer Connection ](http://developer.omniture.com). The latest JavaScript ` AppMeasurement` library and your saved code archives are still available in ** ` Admin` ** &gt; ** ` Code Manager` **. 
**JavaScript ` AppMeasurement`** 
**H.25.3** 

* Added support to send URLs longer than 255 bytes for an upcoming expansion of the Page URL field in Adobe Data Collection servers. Page URLs longer than 255 bytes are split, with the first 255 bytes appearing in the ` g=` parameter, with the remaining bytes appearing later in the query sting in the ` -g=` query parameter. This helps prevent long URLs from taking precedence over other data in the case of browser truncation, but still enables capturing of long URLs.
* Fixed handling URL decoding for strings that are encoded with a mixed use of ` escape` and ` encodeURIComponent`.
* Fixed an issue in WebKit browsers where link tracking fails if the first server call on the page times out.
* Added a new fallback visitor identification method. See [ SiteCatalyst 15.4 Maintenance Release ](c_01172013.md#section_1D541E61C8B84F36B8C89B9F0E977E0B).
* Added a new ` abort` flag that can be set inside ` doPlugins`. Setting this flag to true causes the AppMeasurement library to not continue with that tracking call. The abort flag is reset with every tracking call, so if a subsequent tracking call also needs to be aborted the flag will need to be set again inside ` doPlugins`. 
  ```
  js  s.doPlugins = function(s) { 
       s.campaign = s.getQueryParam("cid"); 
       if ((!s.campaign) &amp;&amp; (!s.events)) { 
            s.abort = true; 
       } 
  };
  ```
  This lets you centralize the logic you use to identify activity that you do not want to track, such as some custom links or external links in display ads.
** ` AppMeasurement` for Other Platforms** 
See [ AppMeasurement Release History ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/release/index.html) the following for a release history of ` AppMeasurement` on the following platforms: 

* JavaScript
* iOS
* Android
* Flash-Flex
* Windows Phone, XBOX, Sliverlight, and .NET
* BlackBerry
* Java
* PHP
* Symbian

**Fixes** 

* International multi-byte characters relying on Shift-JIS encoding were garbled in comma-separated values (CSV) reports, such as MS Excel. ` Discover` now honors both Shift-JIS encoding and the default UTF-8 encoding.
* Fixed an issue occurring in segments that use Referrer Type, which caused segments to display invalid data.
* Fixed issue that caused multiple sessions when launching ` Discover`. This problem typically occurred when launching ` Discover` from other applications, like ` SiteCatalyst`.
* Fixed an issue that prevented projects from opening.
* Fixed an issue causing missing data and inaccuracy of totals from a scheduled ` Fallout Report` in Excel.
* Improved how the Table Builder takes into account the reporting Date Range.
* Fixed an issue causing the "Discover was unable to start" error message to display unnecessarily.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from cancelling changes to a segment.
* Fixed an auto-column generation problem in the ` Table Builder` that displayed only zeros when manipulating rows and columns.
* Fixed an issue potentially causing segments or metrics in segment folders to disappear. This error occurred only if you were editing the segment or metric during a session timeout.

**Fixes** 

* Improved how request responses are displayed after changing the date range, so that previously selected dates are removed after a refresh.
* Added missing calculated participation metrics to the Reporting API. These participation metrics include Revenue, Orders, Units, Cart Opens, Cart Views, Checkouts, Cart Adds, and Cart Removes.
* Added Exclude Today option. This option always excludes today from the date range, because today's data will not report on a complete day. 
    * Added missing metrics to the Pages Report. The metrics include Visits, Unique Visitors, and Page View.
    * The first line item for a calculated metric in a traffic-based trended report was not displaying data.
    * The trended ` Page Depth Report` displayed an error and did not return data. This report now loads correctly.
    * ReportBuilder showed Daily Unique Visitors for Monthly/Weekly/Quarterly/Yearly Unique Visitors when trended with daily granularity


## Clickstream Data Feeds {#datafeeds}

**Format of post_product_list column when events are present but product is empty** 
In ` post_product_list`, If events are contained on the event list for a given hit but there is no product in the product list, the ` post_product_list` contains four semicolons: 

```
;;;;
```
or in rare cases as semicolon, semicolon, zero, semicolon, zero, semicolon:

```
;;0;0;
```
If you are performing a check for an empty product list you should update your ETL to handle both formats.
**Expansion of page_url and page_event_var1 Columns** 
These columns were expanded to store URLs that are longer that 255 characters. This change enables you to receive the entire URL of each page and tracked link, which might contain long query strings or other values that were previously truncated at 255 characters.
After this change, the page_url and page_event_var1 length will increase from 255 bytes to 64 kilobytes. Update any applications or scripts that you are using to process the data feed to use a 64Kb variable to store these strings. If you are storing the data feed in a database, make sure that the page_url and page_event_var1 columns are large enough to contain a string up to 64Kb. Alternatively, if your systems require the truncated versions of these columns, please make certain your ETL handles truncation appropriately.
This change does not impact the post_page_url or post_page_event_var1 columns, which remain at 255 characters.
**What do I need to do?** 
You need to upgrade your ETL process to handle the expanded columns.
Recent versions of JavaScript AppMeasurement truncate the URL at 255 characters, so an upgrade to JavaScript H.25.3 (released January 2013) is required to start collecting URLs over 255 characters. Other data collection methods (including other AppMeasurement libraries, data insertion API, hard-coded image requests, and full processing and historic data sources) do not truncate the URL, so you might receive long URLs in your data feed toward the end of January 2013.
