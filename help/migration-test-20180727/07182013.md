## Branding Changes to the Marketing Cloud {#section_DFB1B4C9183641C5A59B6A816436A49B}

The ` Adobe Marketing Cloud` is being designed to integrate product solutions with core capabilities. The following table provides the new capability names and how they map to product names. 
As integration progress, we will refer to the capability names more often where appropriate. However, not all product names will change immediately.

## Marketing Reports and Analytics (formerly SiteCatalyst) {#section_D7C278C30E3B4E81B05D036520708295}

* Classification rule builder was updating classifications for only the previous month, instead of the previous six months.
* Renamed video events and metrics displayed the default name in the report navigation menu instead of the new name for some report suites.
* Fields that contained data that is in a right-to-left language was incorrectly displayed in left-to-right order in downloaded or scheduled PDF reports.
* A "You do not have enough ReportBuilder licenses" error was displayed when saving a user in the ARB group. This occurred if the maximum number of licenses was in use, even though the user was already licensed and the maximum was not exceeded.
* Advanced filters on breakdown reports were not being saved in the advanced search dialog. This prevented the search from being viewed or edited again after it was applied.
* When creating an advanced filter, pipe characters ( "|" ) were being improperly escaped, which prevented searching for pipe as a literal character.
* On the ` Mobile Device Type` report, applying a breakdown after a classification hierarchy drill-down caused the report to not display data.
* Summary reportlets that do not have an associated report generated an "Unable to retrieve reportlet" error when they contained metrics for which current data was not supported. These reportlets now display finalized data.
* The ` ClickMap Report` displayed the same data on each page of a multi-page report.
* ` Mobile Device Type` and Mobile ` Operating System` reports were not filtering "Other" line items even when the correct filter was applied.
* The ranked ` Time Spent on Page` report was not displaying data before the ` SiteCatalyst` 15 upgrade date.
* The trended ` Key Metrics` report was not displaying current data for revenue and carts metrics when current data was enabled.
* Compare dates on the ` Full Paths` report displayed 0 for all values for one of the two dates based on the sort order of the report.

## SiteCatalyst 14.9 {#section_B08C37A3BEE746BF97B0CF2AAD58F14A}

The SiteCatalyst 14.9 release (07/18/2013) includes the following changes:

* Scheduled reports that were delivered between May 23 2013 and July 19 2013 with advanced filters applied did not display any data when delivered. This issue affected only scheduled reports and did not impact reports viewed in SiteCatalyst.

## SiteCatalyst 13.5 end of life announced for October 2013 {#section_DB1D3282006D4A5FAFBE57414A3C39BA}

In October 2013, SiteCatalyst 13.5 will no longer be accessible. If you are currently using ` SiteCatalyst` 13.5, the following information will help you plan your migration to a supported version. 

* Notes on reports are not migrated. This information must be manually migrated to the same or equivalent report in a supported version.
* Notes on alerts are no longer supported.
* Dashboards are viewable, but must be migrated before they can be edited. See [ Migrate a legacy dashboard ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/index.html?f=t_dashboard_migrate_legacy).
The following items are available in a supported version with no action:

* Bookmarks
* Calendar Events
* Targets
* Alerts
* Data warehouse requests
* Downloadable and scheduled reports

## Ad Hoc Analysis (formerly Discover) {#section_5FC748F3AFB643C0B9BB54E4B73F887E}

The ad hoc analysis release (07/18/2013) includes the following changes:

* ` Adobe Discover` has been re-branded as a "ad hoc analysis" capability within the ` Adobe Analytics` suite of products.
* Single-Sign On is now supported.
* Social and Mobile App metrics can now be reported in ad hoc analysis (Discover), ` ReportBuilder`, and ` Web Services APIs`.
* Social and Mobile App metrics can now be included in segments created in ad hoc analysis (Discover), reports and analytics, and data warehouse.
* Starting with this maintenance release, ad hoc analysis (Discover) will be changing currency formats in custom events that will affect reports and segments in some cases. For example, ad hoc analysis uses a penny (.01) as the baseline value, but starting next month, all currency will be based on the dollar (1.00). This is the same for all currencies. In most cases, reports and segments previously built will remain unchanged. Most existing reports and segments in the new format will see no changes in values or functionality. The data values in the report will not change but the values in the segment rules will change for currency operations. For example, if you created a custom event that runs in segment with a 50 cent value, then it will be changed to a .50 dollar value and return the same values as it did previously.
  When converting formats is not possible, an error will display in the ` Segment Builder` stating that the variable is obsolete. See the [ KB article ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/home/index.html#kb-dsc-important-changes-revenue-segment-logic) for additional information about rebuilding your segments if needed. 

* Previously, when both rules and containers were embedded within the same parent container, they were joined using the AND operator by default. Joining these embedded entities worked when the AND operator was required, but presented problems when an OR operator was required. Now, for all parent containers that include both rules and embedded containers, these rules are now put in their own container to apply logic evenly to the embedded rules and child containers.

* The pre-configured segment, "Visits Referred by Microsoft Bing," was previously searching only across Live.com. Now, the segment logic has been corrected to include visits where: Search Engines = Microsoft Bing
  OR
  Search Engines = Live.com
  OR
  Search Engines = m.bing


* The Segment Builder window was opening larger than the laptop screen and hiding the Submit button from the user. This is fixed by making sure the Segment Builder window is the same size or smaller than the ad hoc analysis (Discover) window when opened.
* If you had Bounce Rate identified and saved in a report, when you re-opened the report the Bounce Rate did not report as a percentage and instead displayed data as a 0 or 1 (for example 0.58 would be rounded off to 1.0). The fix will properly save new projects, but for previously saved projects you will need to:

    1. Open the project.
    1. Drop in the Bounce Rate again.
    1. Save the project.

* Within the ` Browser Type` report, multiple ** ` Other` ** line items were being displayed. Now, the ** ` Unspecified` ** line item has been added to display data based on input and to match the marketing reports and analytics (SiteCatalyst).
* In the ** ` Segment Builder` **, you can now set visitor sequences based on ** ` Page Views` ** using the ** ` Within` ** operator.
* Running on Java 7 (update 25), some implementations were not rendering properly (such as not painting correctly in the user interface). This issue is fixed.

## Data Workbench (formerly Insight) {#section_7609465FD1644C929A1A3EFF5D3CEB22}

The data workbench release (Insight 5.54 patch) includes the following changes:

* Fixed an SSL connectivity issue with the Query API.

**AppMeasurement for JavaScript** 
**1.0.2**

  ```
  js  &lt;a href="index.htm#anchor.pdf"&gt;Test Link&lt;/a&gt;
  ```
  Now the hash/fragment is ignored so the link is tracked only when the filename ends in an extension that matches .

**H.26.1**
