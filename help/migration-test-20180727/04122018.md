Applying appropriate, secure, and timely deletion policies is an important part of complying with this obligation. As a result, Adobe would like to work with you to implement a data retention policy before GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018.</p> <p><b>What to expect</b> </p> <p>Unless you already have an Adobe Analytics data retention policy in place, Adobe will begin applying data retention as currently specified in customer contracts for Adobe Analytics, unless other arrangements are made.</p> <p>Most Adobe Analytics contracts state that Adobe may delete data after 25 months. Once a data retention policy is in place for your organization, it is enforced on a rolling monthly basis. Data retention for longer periods than 25 months is available for an additional fee. Data retention periods for shorter periods can also be configured by contacting Customer Care.</p> <p>You will soon receive an email with additional details for your organization.</p> <p>Data retention impacts all methods for accessing historical Adobe Analytics data, including but not limited to Reports &amp; Analytics, Analysis Workspace, Report Builder, the Web Services Reporting APIs, data warehouse, and data feeds.</p> <p><b>Next steps</b> </p> <p>Identify stakeholders within your organization responsible for making decisions about data retention. Your organization is best placed to know the appropriate period for which Adobe Analytics data should be retained.</p> <p>Contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager if you have questions regarding data retention for Adobe Analytics.</p> </td>

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* This release adds two new DCS parameters, ` d_tdpid` and ` d_tdpid_ic`. They allow you to limit the trait evaluation to only the traits from a list of data sources. The two new parameters are described in full in our [ DCS reference material ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/dcs-keys.html).
* We updated the way we calculate the cross-device ID metric in Profile Merge Rules. This metric now more accurately reports total devices tied to CRM IDs for customers leveraging authentication as part of their cross-device strategy. Please review the [ Profile Merge Rules ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/profile-link-metrics.html) documentation for more detailed information. (AAM-34509)
* Fixed a bug in Audience Lab, where a destination, when activated, would strip the end parameters from the URL. (AAM-35447)
* Fixed a bug on Internet Explorer 11 and Safari, in the General and Trend Reports page, where the page would crash when users would try to export to CSV.
* Fixed an issue, where customers with RBAC permissions were unable to remove traits revoked from data feeds from their segments. (AAM-28008)
