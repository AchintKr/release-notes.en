## Marketing Reports & Analytics {#fixes_reports_analytics}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue where the ` Search Keywords - All` reportlet reported in a currency that was different from the base currency set for the report suite.
* Fixed an issue where a user who had access to the ` Site Hierarchy Report` on two report suites was unable to switch between the two report suites. An Access Denied error was displayed.
* Fixed an issue that occurred when creating a segment from a ` Fallout Report`. The container changed from Visit (parent report) to Visitor.
* Fixed an error that occurred with a segment that was created in ad hoc analysis and subsequently copied in reports &amp; analytics.
* Fixed the segment preview in Segment Builder to show the correct number of hits, visits, and visitors for the selected date range.
* Fixed an issue that caused Romania to appear twice on the countries list in Segment Builder.
* Fixed an issue with the time selector not working in real time reports on iPads or iPad minis.
* Fixed an issue where menu customizations could not be saved in any language other than English.
* Fixed an issue when breaking down a hierarchy report by page names on reports that cross the Version 15 upgrade date that caused the data to not be correctly sorted.
* Fixed an issue on hourly reports that contain the bounce rate metric to increase the accuracy of bounces reported each hour. Note that this did not impact non-hourly reporting of bounce rate.
* Fixed an issue that caused the total revenue shown for the referring domains report to change when the data comparison feature is used.
* Fixed an issue in the Analytics for Target integration that caused the total count for Activity Conversions to be reported incorrectly in Analytics. The total was reported correctly in the Target Standard.
* Fixed an issue that some numeric 2 classification values to report as 0.
* Fixed an issue that caused instances of referrer types to be reported differently between the Referrer Type Report and Referring Domain Report. The allocation setting for Referrer Type Report now matches the setting for Referring Domain causing instances to be reported consistently between these two reports.

## Report Builder {#fixes_arb}

Not updated in this release.
[ Top ](09182014.md#marketingcloud) 

## Ad Hoc Analysis {#fixes_ad_hoc}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue that occurred after changing the Count Repeat Instances setting from "No" to "Yes" in the ` Next Pages Flow Report`. Repeated items did not show up.
* Fixed a discrepancy between the bounce rates reported by the ` Site Analysis Report` versus the ` Pages Report`.
* Fixed an issue that occurred when creating a segment in reports &amp; analytics using the â€œdoes not contain any of" operator. The ` Segment Builder` preview showed this segment as being compatible with ad hoc analysis. However, the segment could not be found in ad hoc analysis.

## Data Workbench {#fixes_data_workbench}

Not updated in this release.
See [ Data Workbench 6.2 updates ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/insight/whatsnew/?f=c_release_notes_insight_62) for additional release information.

[ Top ](09182014.md#marketingcloud) 

## Clickstream Data Feeds {#clickstream}

Not updated in this release.
[ Top ](09182014.md#marketingcloud) 

## AppMeasurement and Mobile SDKs {#appmeasurement_sdk}

** ` AppMeasurement` for JavaScript** 
**1.4.1** 

* Added a ` tagContainerMarker` variable that allows the implementation to specify up to 4 characters that are appended to the version string along with an additional dash character delimiter. This is used by dynamic tag management. 

  ```
  js  // JavaScript 
  s.tagContainerMarker = "D1.0"; 
    
  // Data Collection request 
  //.../b/ss/myrsid/1/JS-1.4.1-D1.0/s43317392037311?...
  ```
  The 4 characters are limited to characters that are allowed in URL file paths, such as alpha-numeric and period.

* On pages that are dual-tagged with H Code, fixed a loop that might occur during automatic link tracking (download and exit) with when forced link tracking is enabled (default in Webkit browsers). Additionally, added a general safeguard around automatic link tracking to prevent similar loops. This safeguard limits automatic link tracking of repeated clicks to the *same* object to once every 10 seconds. This safeguard applies only to automatic link tracking, so manual link tracking (s.tl) calls are not limited. Clicks to different objects are also not impacted by this safeguard and will be tracked.
* Fixed handling of clicked object when a delay is needed.
* Fixed an issue that caused a double page-view count when s.t was called from a link onclick function, if the Visitor API does not have the needed values yet.
* HTTP POST support. See [ New Features in Analytics ](09182014.md#features_analytics).
**JavaScript H code (Legacy)** 
**H.27.4** 

* Added a ` tagContainerMarker` variable that allows the implementation to specify up to 4 characters that are appended to the version string along with an additional dash character delimiter. This is used by dynamic tag management. 

  ```
  js  // JavaScript 
  s.tagContainerMarker = "D1.0"; 
    
  // Data Collection request 
  //.../b/ss/myrsid/1/JS-1.4.1-D1.0/s43317392037311?...
  ```

**Marketing Cloud Visitor ID Service** 
**1.3.2** 

* Fixed an issue that might cause an invalid ` Marketing Cloud` Visitor IDs to be generated by the fallback mechanism when handling timeouts.
** ` AppMeasurement` for Other Platforms** 
See [ AppMeasurement Release History ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/release/index.html) the following for a release history of ` AppMeasurement` on the following platforms: 

* JavaScript
* iOS
* Android
* Flash-Flex
* OSX
* Windows Phone, XBOX, Silverlight, and .NET
* BlackBerry
* Java
* PHP
* Symbian
