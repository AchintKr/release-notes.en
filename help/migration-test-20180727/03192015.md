**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with the funnel image. If no data was present for the specific audience, but there was data for All Users, the All Users line would be a flat line rather than a funnel. Also improved spacing on this image.
* Fixed no or partial loading of apps when the company contained a large (100+) number of apps with large data sets.

## Dynamic Tag Management (03/24/2015) {#dtm}

**Fixes** 

* Updated the variable and event interface for the `Adobe Analytics` tool to allow auto-complete selection and to enable access to additional eVars and events for `Analytics Premium` accounts.
* Fixed an issue where the `Store Path` option for FTP library deployments was not updating for production libraries when using nested directories.
* Updated data elements to support hyphened names.
* Fixed an issue where the column indicator in the `Rules` table displayed for a rule, even if the tool was deleted.
* Updated the `Sequential HTML` code option to be available for page-load rules only. This option no longer appears for event-based rules. A notice displays with a `Sequential HTML` tag on an event-based rule to notify users to change the tag before the rule can be saved.
* Fixed an issue where the `Sign in with Adobe ID` login option wasnâ€™t allowing users to sign in as a different user. Users can click `Sign in with a Different Adobe ID` to log out as the current `Marketing Cloud` user and be redirected to the Adobe login page.

## Marketing Reports & Analytics {#fixes_reports_analytics}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue where the ** `Select All` ** checkbox in ** `Segment Manager` ** selected more segments than expected when a filter was applied. It now selects only the visible, active segments.
* Fixed an issue where breaking down the `Servers` report by * `Site Sections` * or * `Page Names` * returned a `Top Level Domains` report instead.
* Fixed a naming conflict in scheduled reports that caused unintended delivery of scheduled reports data.
* Fixed an error condition that pointed to a missing report name when trying to send a report that already contained a report name.
* Fixed an issue with alerts for mobile reports (Device Name, Device Type, Manufacturer, etc.) not working properly. 
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This fix requires that you recreate all alerts for mobile reports.


* Fixed an issue where filters were not persisted when linking to a report.
* Fixed an issue where non-admin users could not edit or delete their public bookmark folders.
* Fixed an issue where in password recovery emails, Adobeâ€™s sender domain (omniture.com) did not match the * `From` * value (adobe.com). This resulted in these emails being blocked and never received by the user. The * `From` * value has been changed to `httpd@omniture.com`.
* Fixed a real-time reports issue that caused the truncation of multi-byte characters in variable values.
* Fixed the issue with file attachments from reports &amp; analytics not showing up in the Apple Mail client (Mac, iOS).
* Fixed an issue where Scheduled / Downloadable Reports that contained calculated metrics with the Compare Dates option failed.
* Fixed an issue where search results did not persist after a report was scheduled in the Scheduled Reports Manager.
* Fixed an Anomaly Detection issue where data did not change after switching to another report suite.
[Top](03192015.md#marketingcloud) 

## Report Builder {#fixes_arb}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with the Visits metric not showing up in the `Available Metric` list on the second page of the `Request Wizard` in Report Builder.
[Top](03192015.md#marketingcloud) 

## Ad Hoc Analysis {#fixes_ad_hoc}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue where calculated metrics with embedded segments were not saving properly in the site analysis settings.
* Fixed an issue with * `hour` * granularity that showed different results depending on whether it was set to * `Rows` * or * `Columns` *.

## Data Warehouse {#fixes_data_warehouse}

**Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue with data warehouse reports not getting delivered when the email address was set as the clients company's email address in the From field. All data warehouse reports are now sent from `no-reply@omniture.com`.
* Fixed a problem that sometimes resulted in corrupted output files.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data warehouse access from Version 14 has been removed.[Learn more](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/?f=whatsnew_segments)

[Top](03192015.md#marketingcloud) 

## Clickstream Data Feeds {#clickstream}


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The following data feed column sizes will increase in a future release (no sooner than 3 months from now):


* geo_zip field - column size will increase from 16 to 50 bytes.
* geo_region field - column size will increase from 32 to 255 bytes.
* geo_city field - column size will increase from 32 to 255 bytes.
[Top](03192015.md#marketingcloud) 
**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* Effective March 1, 2015, `Adobe Social` will no longer support geo-targeting of tweets. Twitter requires that all geo-targeting leverage the Ads API. We are working with Twitter to reintroduce geo-targeting at a later date. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. Please reach out to your Social Account Manager or Customer Success/Support representative if you have additional questions.
* Fixed an issue that temporarily prevented `Social` from collecting metrics for YouTube channels.
* A one-time Facebook Publisher Authorization page will be triggered upon log in asking customers, who are currently using a Facebook custom publisher app, to authorize the `Adobe Social` new publisher app for each user's linked Facebook account(s). This is required for when we upgrade to the new Facebook graph API in April.
* Fixed an issue that caused metric discrepancies between those reported in `Adobe Analytics`and in YouTube for owned social properties.
