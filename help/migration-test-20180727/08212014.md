## Marketing Reports & Analytics {#fixes_reports_analytics}

**Fixes** 

* When downloading the ` Next Page` report to Excel or CSV, the report did not show the correct data. PDF and Word did show the correct data.
* Users were unable to download ** ` Marketing Channels` ** &gt; ** ` Marketing Channel Overview Report` ** in Excel format.
* After the user deleted a dashboard, scheduled reports kept delivering but could not be found in the ` Schedule Manager`.
* When copying a shared dashboard through ** ` Copy me` ** in ` Manage Dashboards`, the copied dashboard inherited the scheduling of the original dashboard and the original dashboard lost it.
* Segmentation: Exclude sub-containers did not show up as red in Internet Explorer.
* List variables were not available in Data Extract reporting.
* Users were unable to use correlations even if they had access to traffic.
* Publishing widgets did not show correct date ranges.
* Report suite selection search field was not working for certain report suites.
* After applying a segment to a dashboard, the ** ` Save` ** button was not available.
* ` Scheduled Reports Manager` did not display any scheduled reports.
* When searching within ** ` Scheduled Reports Manager` ** &gt; ** ` Report Logs` **, the filter did not honor the date range selected and defaulted back to May to July 2014.
* Fixed an issue that caused the Amazon Kindle Fire HD to be incorrectly identified on the ` Device Type Report`. This device is now reported correctly.
* Fixed an issue that caused some Android 4.4.2 phones to be reported as Linux OS on the ` Device Type Report`. These devices are now reported correctly.
[ Top ](08212014.md#marketingcloud) 

## Report Builder {#fixes_arb}

**Fixes** 

* ` Current Day` reports did not refresh correctly for some time zones. ` Current Day` reports will refresh based on report suite time zone.
* Retrieving bookmarks and dashboards slowed down report builder authentication. Moving the retrieval of bookmarks and dashboards to Request Wizard Step 1 solved this issue. Bookmarks and dashboards are now imported only when users click the bookmark or dashboard.
* Refreshing some workbooks with a number of requests resulted in an error.
[ Top ](08212014.md#marketingcloud) 

## Ad Hoc Analysis {#fixes_ad_hoc}

**Fixes** 

* In May 2014, Single Page Visits was inadvertently renamed to Single Access. In August 2014, this name change was reverted.
* A new Single Access metric was added. This metric allows you to view the number of visits where there was only one value in a visit, and is also available in Report &amp; Analytics.
* ` Current Day` reports did not refresh correctly for some time zones. With this fix, the ` Current Day` reports will refresh as designed.
* Instance metrics for Marketing Channels were not displaying in the left pane of Ad Hoc Analysis. The Instance metrics now display correctly.
* The Save Project As feature was not working in earlier versions. This has now been fixed.

## Data Warehouse {#fixes_data_warehouse}

**Fixes** 

* ` Referrer` report was incorrectly reporting internal referrers.
* Running a data warehouse report on a currency metric with a visit-level breakdown resulted in incorrect data.
[ Top ](08212014.md#marketingcloud)
