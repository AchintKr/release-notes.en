          <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> Video Measurement
			 Libraries</title>
        <p>This release provides a new version of the 
			 <keyword>Media Module</keyword> that is used to measure video
			 consumption. The new version of the 
			 <keyword>Media Module</keyword> collects video data using Custom
			 Conversion Variables (eVars) and Custom Events. Using these variables to
			 collect video data lets you integrate video data with other 
			 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> data in your reports (Legacy pev3
			 video data was collected using a custom variable that prevented integration).
			 This change enhances your ability to analyze the impact of video on other
			 aspects of your online marketing strategy. 
		  </p>
        <p>You can implement the new video measurement on 
			 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14 in preparation for your 
			 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15 migration. Integrated video
			 tracking can be implemented on 
			 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 14, and is required by 
			 <keyword>SiteCatalyst</keyword> 15.
