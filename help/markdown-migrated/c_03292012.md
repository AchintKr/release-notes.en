The `keyword SiteCatalyst` 15.2 maintenance release (03/29/2012) includes the following enhancements and fixes:

**Change to Referring Domain Allocation**

The allocation for referring domains was changed from original to most recent. This change applies to all data collected since your SiteCatalyst 15 upgrade date. Referring Domain allocation now matches Discover, but is changed from the Original Value allocation that is used in SiteCatalyst 14. After this release you will see a change to the credit assigned each referring domain in the Referring Domains report.

In SiteCatalyst 15, the allocation type for Referring Domains is no longer configurable. Any change you make to the Referring Domains Allocation setting on the Finding Methods page is not applied. See [Finding Methods](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/admin/index.html?f=t_finding_methods.html) in the Admin Console Help.

**Fixes in this release:**

* Fixed an issue that prevented some non-admin users that belong to custom groups to see an error when trying to access the `wintitle Exclude by IP` page.
* Fixed an issue that caused some large reportlets to display an error when they were first accessed after being saved.
* Fixed an issue that caused some custom event totals to appear too high in the `wintitle Referring Domains Report`.

* Fixed ASI issue where, under some circumstances, ecommerce data would be zeroed. This issue caused data discrepancies between ASI segments and other identical `keyword Marketing Cloud` segments.

    <td colname="col1"> <p> Why was the interface color changed to a dark, carbon palette? </p> </td> 
    <td colname="col2"> <p> To reduce eye strain. Adobe's research indicates that Discover users typically spend longer hours analyzing data in the Discover interface than in other Suite products like SiteCatalyst. Products like Adobe Insight, Adobe Lightroom, and AutoCAD have shown that the carbon palette reduces eye strain caused by prolonged exposure to light-intensive interfaces. When you paste Discover data into other applications, or deliver scheduled reports, the output changes to a light color palette for printing. </p> </td>
