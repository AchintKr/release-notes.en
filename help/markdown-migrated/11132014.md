**Deprecated Functionality**


* As of November 5, 2014, Facebook Platform Policy no longer allows you to gate applications or application content based on whether or not a person has liked a page. The Social 3.4 release reflects this change by removing Like Gate and non-fan splash page functionality from the `wintitle  Application Builder`. For more information about Facebook's policy change and how you will be affected, see [ Facebook Like Gate Deprecation ](http://help-forums.adobe.com/content/adobeforums/en/social-forum/adobe-social.topic.html/forum__yxzi-facebook_likegating.html) in the [ Adobe Social Forum ](http://help-forums.adobe.com/content/adobeforums/en/social-forum/adobe-social.html).
* The legacy Facebook Moderation tool has been deprecated. Use the Unified Moderation tool to moderate content for all platforms, including Facebook.

**Fixes**

In addition to the new features and enhancements described above, fixes in `keyword  Social` 3.4 focus on improved performance, scalability, usability, and reliability. More than 625 back-end fixes and enhancements address these areas. The fixes highlighted below describe resolutions for the more important customer-reported issues.


* Fixed a display issue when filtering the `wintitle  Social Buzz` report using the `wintitle  Show Spam` option.
* Fixed an issue that caused metrics numbers in the `wintitle  Social Buzz` report's trend graph and `wintitle  Display Name` sections to not match.
* Fixed a display issue in the `wintitle  Social Buzz` report's `wintitle  Display Name` section that caused the bars on the chart to display out of order and some metric values to display as 0.
* Fixed an issue that caused direct messages to not display in the relevant posts feed.
* Fixed an issue with moderation feeds that caused the `wintitle  Read` flag to not work as expected in direct-message feeds.
* Fixed an issue in moderation feeds that sometimes caused numbers to display as "####" instead of the actual numbers.
* Fixed an issue that caused an "Uncaught TypeError" message to display after setting filters in the `wintitle  Content Calendar` then navigating away from and then back to the `wintitle  Content Calendar`.
* Fixed an issue with the `wintitle  Content Calendar` `wintitle  Week View` that caused the `wintitle  Post Status` filter to not be respected.
* Fixed an issue that prevented a post from failing when a linked image could not be retrieved.
* Fixed an issue that caused content with the `wintitle  Post Immediately` setting to take longer than expected to post.
* Fixed an issue that caused an incorrect follower count to display when using a LinkedIn targeting parameter.

* Process monitor now restarts apache processes.
* Implemented a `term  Reveal Facet Item` action in Business Rules.
* On the `wintitle  Adjust Ranking Weights` page, you now have the ability to adjust the `uicontrol  Rule &amp; Relevancy Balance` setting in 1% increments.
