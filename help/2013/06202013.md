**Notices**

  *
  Internet Explorer 7 is no longer tested for compatibility with the `keyword SiteCatalyst` UI. Data collection continues to work as expected for customers using Internet Explorer 7.
  
  
* In October 2013, the `keyword SiteCatalyst` 13.5 interface will no longer be accessible. All scheduled reports that were created in `keyword SiteCatalyst` 13.5 must be migrated to a supported version before this date.
**Fixes**

* When current data was enabled, revenue, orders, and other event reports were incorrectly duplicating values every other hour during the current day.
* Compare reports did not support more than one level of subrelations in a classification hierarchy. Compare reports now provides a comparison through each level.
* Conversion reports with hourly granularity were incorrectly showing that current data is available. This caused the value for the current hour to be displayed for all future hours of the report. The current data option is now correctly disabled for these reports.
* PDF downloads of text reportlets displayed an "HTML error on line 1: Malformed XHTML" error message.
* Some Excel reports were not emailed after clicking `wintitle Send`.
* In downloaded Excel reports, path length did not match the correct value that was displayed in `keyword SiteCatalyst`.
* When viewing multiple report suites in different browsers or tabs as the same user, processing rules were saved to the last selected report suite by that user. Rules are now saved to the report suite that is selected in that tab or window.
* In the `wintitle Admin Console`, changing some variable settings across multiple report suites caused a "Report not Available at this Time" error. These changes are now saved correctly across the selected report suites.
See [SiteCatalyst 15 Help](https://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/sc/user/index.html?f=c_whatsnew) for more information.

## SiteCatalyst 14.9 Maintenance Release {#section_9E13EFA18B1A446E87299DE64B062129}

The `keyword SiteCatalyst` 14.9 maintenance release (06/20/2013) includes the following change:

* The `wintitle Keyword Unavailable ASI` segment definition was not displayed in `keyword SiteCatalyst` 14.
## Discover 3.2 Maintenance Release {#section_657454F058D645C69123910892DB3C5F}

The Discover 3.2 maintenance release (06/20/2013) includes the following changes:

* Excel and CSV reports would not list filenames that began with M or any filename that followed alphabetically. This has been fixed.
* Titles on classification reports in `keyword Discover` menus displayed their parent names instead of the proper subordinate classification titles. This feature now displays correctly.
* Custom events in reports not enabled were improperly appearing in the `keyword Discover` menus, cluttering the menus and forcing them to scroll off the screen. These menus now display correctly.
* In scheduled Excel reports, some columns were compressed (usually columns A and B) and hidden from view when opened. These columns now expand correctly when opening the Excel table.
>[!NOTE] {type="attention"}
>
>Starting with the July maintenance release, Discover will be changing currency formats in custom events that will affect reports and segments in some cases. For example, Discover uses a penny (.01) as the baseline value, but starting next month, all currency will be based on the dollar (1.00). This is the same for all currencies.
In most cases, reports and segments previously built in Discover will remain unchanged. Most existing reports and segments in the new format will see no changes in values or functionality. The data values in the report will not change but the values in the segment rules will change for currency operations. For example, if you created a custom event that runs in segment with a 50 cent value, then it will be changed to a .50 dollar value and return the same values as it did previously.

When converting formats is not possible, an error will display in the Segment Builder stating that the variable is obsolete. See the [KB article](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/home/index.html#kb-dsc-important-changes-revenue-segment-logic) for additional information about rebuilding your segments if needed.

## DataWarehouse {#section_178051456D0847FAA6BF6B0B3E453D6B}

These values can now be reported in DataWarehouse. </td>

* Segments based on events 51-100 were not returning data. Existing segments that are based on events in this range must be re-created in `keyword DataWarehouse`.
* When a DataWarehouse segment that contains Time Spent per Visit is displayed in Discover, it is displayed as Seconds Spent per Visit.
