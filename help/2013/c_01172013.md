This release fixes the following issues:


* Under certain conditions, profile export targeting rules were being deleted.
* When editing reusable segments, changes were saved even if `uicontrol  Cancel` was clicked in the `wintitle  Save` dialog box.
* The default sort order for date options in the `wintitle  Campaigns List` has been changed so newest items display first.
* When a segment was added, the `wintitle  Campaign Edit` page scrolled to the top. It now remains on the Segments section of the page.
* Fixed a date discrepancy in Daily Results on dates when the DST time change occurs reported by customers in certain time zones.
* Social target from Twitter was including visitors from Pinterest.
* When report values were digits or more, the values were returned in scientific notation in the API. Small numbers were still recorded as normal integers. This caused problems when clients pulled data from the APIs programmatically and tried to perform the same actions across all the data in the API, only to find out after that the format changes.
* If you unchecked a deleted experience from the graph and then changed anything on the reports (date range, segments, success metric, and so on), the unchecked experiences did not stay unchecked.
* New campaigns had "Today" as their default date range instead of "Life of Campaign."
* When the name or description of a saved segment was changed, the changes were not saved. Other properties saved as expected.
* REST profile passing requests also ran through the normal mbox processing path, slowing down the passing of profiles.

**Fixes:**

* A permissions issue prevented some users from accessing `wintitle  Target` reports, even when assigned the correct privileges.
* New segments created on a dashboard did not appear in the `wintitle  Segmentation` drop-down list until a refresh, even though the segment was created and saved correctly.
* A data discrepancy was displayed between the top items on the `wintitle  Referring Domains Report` and the line items in the report for the week that a report suite was upgraded to `keyword  SiteCatalyst` 15
* A breakdown based on an unspecified value in a classification displayed all classification values, rather than only values specific to the selected line item.
* Some line item values did not appear for selection in the `wintitle  Fallout Builder`, even when the values appeared in the variable report.
* Line item totals were not displayed on the `wintitle  Geosegmentation Regions Report`.
* On dashboards that were migrated from `keyword  SiteCatalyst` 14 to `keyword  SiteCatalyst` 15, some notes were not displaying in the printed version of the report.
* Legends were not displayed on bar charts in dashboards.
* Correlations launched from the `wintitle  Mobile Devices Report` were limited to a maximum of 50 items. All report items now display in these reports.
* Some users were unable to view breakdowns on the `wintitle  Mobile` reports, even when assigned the correct privileges.
* The `wintitle  Compare Dates` feature did not work on `wintitle  Mobile` breakdown reports.
* Added Instances as an available metric in the Server, Site Section, Visitor State, and Visitor ZIP/Postal Code reports.
* Traffic reports with daily granularity displayed different values in some circumstances for the carts metric in `keyword  ReportBuilder` and `keyword  SiteCatalyst`.
* Detail reports opened by clicking a referrer on the `wintitle  Referring Domains Report` showed results for referrers that do not match the selected referrer. Now only the selected referrer shows results on these detail reports.
* In the `wintitle  Browser Type Report`, some calculated metrics did not display in the trended view, but displayed correctly in the ranked view. Calculated metrics now display correctly in both views.
* When editing conversion variable expiration settings with multiple reports suite selected, variables with custom expiration lengths displayed "Day" instead of the custom length. These variables now display the custom expiration length.
* Changed the Total Visits on the `wintitle  Visits Report` to display the total for the month listed in the heading. This row previously displayed 4 weeks of data and matched the totals row at the bottom of the report.
## SiteCatalyst
     14.9 Maintenance Release {#section_0B24C16DC769418FA51C592463A47DEC}

The `keyword  SiteCatalyst` 14.9 maintenance release (01/17/2013) includes the following improvements:

* The `wintitle  Compare Dates` feature did not work on `wintitle  Mobile` breakdown reports.
* When editing conversion variable expiration settings with multiple reports suite selected, variables with custom expiration lengths displayed "Day" instead of the custom length. These variables now display the custom expiration length.
## AppMeasurement & Mobile {#appmeasurement}

`keyword  AppMeasurement` libraries for all platforms except JavaScript are now hosted on [ Developer Connection ](http://developer.omniture.com). The latest JavaScript `keyword  AppMeasurement` library and your saved code archives are still available in `uicontrol  Admin` &gt; `uicontrol  Code Manager`.

**JavaScript `keyword  AppMeasurement`**

**H.25.3**

* Added support to send URLs longer than 255 bytes for an upcoming expansion of the Page URL field in Adobe Data Collection servers. Page URLs longer than 255 bytes are split, with the first 255 bytes appearing in the `codeph  g=` parameter, with the remaining bytes appearing later in the query sting in the `codeph  -g=` query parameter. This helps prevent long URLs from taking precedence over other data in the case of browser truncation, but still enables capturing of long URLs.
* Fixed handling URL decoding for strings that are encoded with a mixed use of `codeph  escape` and `codeph  encodeURIComponent`.
* Fixed an issue in WebKit browsers where link tracking fails if the first server call on the page times out.
* Added a new fallback visitor identification method. See [ SiteCatalyst 15.4 Maintenance Release ](c_01172013.md#concept_461AB52E6750482AB8D044205D4BFBB8/section_1D541E61C8B84F36B8C89B9F0E977E0B).
* Added a new `codeph  abort` flag that can be set inside `codeph  doPlugins`. Setting this flag to true causes the AppMeasurement library to not continue with that tracking call. The abort flag is reset with every tracking call, so if a subsequent tracking call also needs to be aborted the flag will need to be set again inside `codeph  doPlugins`.
  ```js
  s.doPlugins = function(s) { 
   s.campaign = s.getQueryParam("cid"); 
   if ((!s.campaign) &amp;&amp; (!s.events)) { 
   s.abort = true; 
   } 
  };
  ```
  This lets you centralize the logic you use to identify activity that you do not want to track, such as some custom links or external links in display ads.

**Fixes**

* International multi-byte characters relying on Shift-JIS encoding were garbled in comma-separated values (CSV) reports, such as MS Excel. `keyword  Discover` now honors both Shift-JIS encoding and the default UTF-8 encoding.
* Fixed an issue occurring in segments that use Referrer Type, which caused segments to display invalid data.
* Fixed issue that caused multiple sessions when launching `keyword  Discover`. This problem typically occurred when launching `keyword  Discover` from other applications, like `keyword  SiteCatalyst`.
* Fixed an issue that prevented projects from opening.
* Fixed an issue causing missing data and inaccuracy of totals from a scheduled `wintitle  Fallout Report` in Excel.
* Improved how the Table Builder takes into account the reporting Date Range.
* Fixed an issue causing the "Discover was unable to start" error message to display unnecessarily.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from cancelling changes to a segment.
* Fixed an auto-column generation problem in the `wintitle  Table Builder` that displayed only zeros when manipulating rows and columns.
* Fixed an issue potentially causing segments or metrics in segment folders to disappear. This error occurred only if you were editing the segment or metric during a session timeout.

**Fixes**

* Added missing calculated participation metrics to the Reporting API. These participation metrics include Revenue, Orders, Units, Cart Opens, Cart Views, Checkouts, Cart Adds, and Cart Removes.
* Added Exclude Today option. This option always excludes today from the date range, because today's data will not report on a complete day.
    * Added missing metrics to the Pages Report. The metrics include Visits, Unique Visitors, and Page View.
    * The first line item for a calculated metric in a traffic-based trended report was not displaying data.
    * The trended `wintitle  Page Depth Report` displayed an error and did not return data. This report now loads correctly.
    * ReportBuilder showed Daily Unique Visitors for Monthly/Weekly/Quarterly/Yearly Unique Visitors when trended with daily granularity
  
## Clickstream Data Feeds {#datafeeds}

**Format of post_product_list column when events are present but product is empty**

In `codeph  post_product_list`, If events are contained on the event list for a given hit but there is no product in the product list, the `codeph  post_product_list` contains four semicolons:

```
;;;;
```
or in rare cases as semicolon, semicolon, zero, semicolon, zero, semicolon:

```
;;0;0;
```
If you are performing a check for an empty product list you should update your ETL to handle both formats.

** Expansion of page_url and page_event_var1 Columns**

These columns were expanded to store URLs that are longer that 255 characters. This change enables you to receive the entire URL of each page and tracked link, which might contain long query strings or other values that were previously truncated at 255 characters.

After this change, the page_url and page_event_var1 length will increase from 255 bytes to 64 kilobytes. Update any applications or scripts that you are using to process the data feed to use a 64Kb variable to store these strings. If you are storing the data feed in a database, make sure that the page_url and page_event_var1 columns are large enough to contain a string up to 64Kb. Alternatively, if your systems require the truncated versions of these columns, please make certain your ETL handles truncation appropriately.

This change does not impact the post_page_url or post_page_event_var1 columns, which remain at 255 characters.

**What do I need to do?**

You need to upgrade your ETL process to handle the expanded columns.

Recent versions of JavaScript AppMeasurement truncate the URL at 255 characters, so an upgrade to JavaScript H.25.3 (released January 2013) is required to start collecting URLs over 255 characters. Other data collection methods (including other AppMeasurement libraries, data insertion API, hard-coded image requests, and full processing and historic data sources) do not truncate the URL, so you might receive long URLs in your data feed toward the end of January 2013.

See the [ Clickstream Data Feeds ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/clickstream/index.html?f=c_new_features) help for the latest information.

## Web Services API {#webservices}

**Fixes**
  *
  The `wintitle  Terms Report` now ignores the asterisk character.
  
  
  *
  Open `uicontrol  Reports` &gt; `uicontrol  Null Search Terms Report`, select a time slot and then view the report. Clicked one word in the report to open the search, and then click `uicontrol  View Report` again. The search count of the keyword you clicked increased twice. This is now fixed.
  
  
  *
  A performance optimization was made for when you push Business Rules live.
  
  
  *
  The ability to remove in `wintitle  Breadcrumbs` did not work all the time.
  
  
  *
  Unless you used `uicontrol  Regenerate`, the `wintitle  Re-Rank Index` feature did not allow any changed `wintitle  Ranking Rules` to take effect in search results.
